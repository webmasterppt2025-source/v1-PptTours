Stay hydrated, ascend slowly, avoid alcohol, rest plenty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can this be done in one day?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 7 lagoon circuit can be done in one long day. Adding more lagoons for the 12 lagoon experience might require either starting very early, moving at good pace, or expanding to a 2 day itinerary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are de extra lagoons safe to swim in?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally no high altitude, very cold water. Most tours do not encourage swimming except in thermal springs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When is the best time of year?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dry season: May through October.

Leading Peru Travel notes that lack of rain and humidity &ldquo;maximizes saturation of colors.&rdquo;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Wet Season (October &ndash; March):</strong> Clouds, mist, or light rain can veil the mountain&rsquo;s stripes. Minerals may appear muted or washed out. Salkantay Trekking writes that frequent rainfall and cloudiness &ldquo;can decrease the visibility of the colors. In some cases, snow or ice may partially cover the slopes, hiding the colors temporarily.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, even the same geological formation can look dramatically different when wet versus dry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Trail Conditions and Accessibility</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Dry Season:</strong> Trails are firmer, less slippery, and safer to hike. Less risk of landslides or washouts. March to September are described as &ldquo;optimal conditions&rdquo; for exploration.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Wet Season:</strong> Rainfall softens trails, causes mud, makes higher altitude passes slippery, and occasionally forces route adjustments or delays. Some tour companies even caution visitors about poor visibility or difficulties.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In short: wet season means more challenge and risk, while dry season gives more predictable access.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Temperature, Wind and Weather Variability</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Because Rainbow Mountain sits over <strong>5,000 meters (&asymp;5,200 m / ~17,060 ft in many accounts)</strong>, temperatures remain cold year-round, especially early morning or late evening.</li>\r\n	<li>During <strong>dry season</strong>, daytime temps may reach <strong>~10&ndash;15 &deg;C</strong>, but mornings and nights can drop well below freezing (&minus;5 &deg;C or colder).</li>\r\n	<li>In <strong>wet season</strong>, humidity increases, storms cause sudden temperature drops, wind may be stronger, and snow or hail is possible at the summit.</li>\r\n	<li>Because of altitude, you might feel all four seasons in one day&mdash;sun, wind, cold, rain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Crowds and Visitor Experience</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Dry Season, Peak Tourist Months:</strong> More visitors, more tours, earlier bookings required. The clear views draw crowds.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Wet Season,&nbsp;Fewer Tourists:</strong> Many avoid going because of risk and obscured views. But for adventurers who don&rsquo;t mind the weather, there can be more solitude and a more &ldquo;wild&rdquo; experience.</li>\r\n	<li>In transitional months, you may catch fewer crowds and still acceptable views&mdash;especially in April or October.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Unique Seasonal Occurrences</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Snow Cover and Temporary White-Out:</strong> During heavy rain / snowfall (wet months), parts of Rainbow Mountain may be snowed over, hiding stripes. As the sun hits, the snow may melt to reveal the colors beneath. Salkantay Trekking mentions this &ldquo;half-snow, half-color&rdquo; phenomenon in some seasons.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Color Reveal After Snow Melt:</strong> In periods where the snow recedes, previously hidden bands may appear (in spring/early dry season) as more layers emerge. This makes early dry season (April&ndash;May) interesting.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Flora and Fauna Variations:</strong> After rains, pasture grasses, flowers, and wetlands may be more vibrant in surrounding landscapes, contrasting with the mountain&rsquo;s stripes. This can amplify the visual setting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', '0000-00-00', '', 1, 'admin', 23),

sticks and air mattresses are optional   and serve to provide greater comfort during the walk.&nbsp;If you do not want   to bring any camping gear you can always rent from our office.</p>   <p><strong>Sleeping bag&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $.&nbsp;20 usd per person</strong></p>   <p><strong>Air Matras&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $.&nbsp;20 usd per person</strong></p>   <p><strong>Walking sticks (pair)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $.&nbsp;USD 15 per person</strong></p>   <ul>     <li><strong>headlamps:</strong> it&nbsp;is strongly recommended to bring a   head lamp for the evenings.&nbsp;There will be no lights on the camping sites   and it will be difficult to get to your dining tent or bathroom tent   without one.&nbsp;Hand lanterns are acceptable, if you do not have a head   lamp, but it makes some tasks difficult.</li>     <li><strong>Huayna Picchu</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Huayna Picchu is the mountain that   is seen behind Machu Picchu in the classic photos, to go up this   mountain you need to buy an additional entrance and it has a cost of   $.&nbsp;35 dollars per person, however,&nbsp;this entrance must be requested at   the time of your reservation and it will be confirmed according to   availability of spaces as they only allow 200 people.</li>     <li><strong>Flights.</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Flying to Cusco can be   complicated.&nbsp;Delays occur frequently especially between October to March   and it is not uncommon for flights to be canceled.&nbsp;Make sure you arrive   in the city at least two days before the start date of your trek to   Machu Picchu.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;is the most reliable airline.&nbsp;Avianca and Peruvian   Airlines&nbsp;are also acceptable companies.&nbsp;You will not return from your   tour on the last day until around 8 pm So make sure your flight is not   the day of the Machu Picchu Tour, rather the next day.</li>     <li><strong>Tips</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Tips are always appreciated and should be   based entirely on your level of satisfaction.&nbsp;Although it may not be   usual for you, it has considerable importance to the people who will   assist you during your trek.</li>     <li><strong>Travel insurance.</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; To protect your travel   investment, we recommend the purchase&nbsp;a travel insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel   insurance before leaving home is highly recommended and very   easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending on your country of   origin and at different prices according to your time of stay, take some   time to review them and hire the one that best suits you.&nbsp;This is an   excellent way to protect yourself while visiting&nbsp;Peru.</li>   </ul>', '  <h3>Breafing (Previous Information)</h3>   <p>All information sessions are held in our office at 06:00 PM the night   before your trek.&nbsp;If you cannot assist to this talk please contact our   office staff to serve you better.</p>   <h3>Duffle Bags</h3>   <p>You will receive your duffle bag at the information session.&nbsp;These   bags are to put your belongings inside it, these will be carried by the   porters and will be returned to you each evening at the   campsite.&nbsp;However, beside from these bags, you should carry a small   backpack where you will carry everything you need during the trek.</p>   <p>Each duffle bag must have a maximum weight of 7kg.&nbsp;4kg will be for   your clothes and other personal items, the other 3kg will be for our   logistics, such as your sleeping bag and pad, if you have your own   sleeping bag and mat these must be included in the 7 kilos.</p>   <h3>Arrive in Cusco</h3>   <p>The best way to get to Cusco is by air and there are several&nbsp;airline options.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latam.com/en_us/\">LATAM</a>&nbsp;tends   to be the most expensive, but it has&nbsp;more&nbsp;flight&nbsp;options.&nbsp;But you also   have&nbsp;PERUVIAN, AVIANCA, STAR PERU, LC PERU&nbsp;to choose according to your   preference.&nbsp;Expect&nbsp;flight delays or cancellations,&nbsp;due to the   high&nbsp;altitude of Cusco, tends to be difficult to land&nbsp;so that on rainy   days you can paralyze&nbsp;air traffic.&nbsp;Bus tours&nbsp;are always available and   although the journey may be long, especially from&nbsp;Lima,&nbsp;Peru buses&nbsp;are   well maintained and are comfortable.&nbsp;This option is recommended if you   come from a city closer to&nbsp;Cusco like Puno or Arequipa.&nbsp;Buses from Lima   will take around 20 hours to arrive to Cusco.</p>   <h3>Pick Up from The Hotels.</h3>   <p>We pick up all our clients from the hotel for all tours.&nbsp;While your   hotel is in the center of the city of Cusco, we will coordinate this   pick up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;guide at the information session.&nbsp;Pick-up&nbsp;times&nbsp;may   vary between 20 and 30&nbsp;minutes depending on traffic conditions and   hotel&nbsp;locations.</p>   <p>Cusco is an ancient city with cobblestone streets and very narrow   corridors.&nbsp;Very small hotels and Air BNBs are often located on streets   that cars cannot pass through.&nbsp;They are also usually located on the side   of the hill, with long and steep climbs to the property, difficult to   maneuver with luggage.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not&nbsp;stay in one of these   places and try to find places where there is easy access to carry your   bags.</p>   <h3>Leaving Machu Picchu requires a lot of logistics,&nbsp;but&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is&nbsp;included in your journey.</h3>   <p>From Machu Picchu&nbsp;Ruins&nbsp;to&nbsp;Machu Picchu Pueblo, you&nbsp;will take a   25-minute bus.&nbsp;The&nbsp;buses are in order of arrival and you can take any of   those in turn.</p>   <p>From Machu Picchu Pueblo,&nbsp;you will take a&nbsp;train&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ollantaytambo or   Poroy&nbsp;station.&nbsp;Your guide will give you your train tickets.&nbsp;Make sure   you get to the platform 30 minutes ahead of time.</p>   <ul>     <li><strong>The train from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo is 2 hours.</strong></li>     <li><strong>The train from Aguas Calientes to Poroy is 3.5 hours.</strong></li>   </ul>   <p>Once you arrive at the train station, look&nbsp;for our staff with a PPT sign.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will take you to the Plaza San Francisco, Cusco.</p>   <ul>     <li><strong>The trip on&nbsp;the van&nbsp;from Ollantaytambo to Plaza de San Francisco is 2 hours</strong></li>     <li><strong>Travel by&nbsp;van&nbsp;from Poroy to&nbsp;San Francisco Plaza is&nbsp;30 minutes</strong></li>   </ul>   <p>Once you arrive at the Plaza San Francisco&nbsp;our staff will be waiting   for you to separate you and send in pre-paid taxis to your respective   hotels.</p>   <h3>Entrance fees to Machu Picchu</h3>   <p>Machu Picchu now has two&nbsp;hours&nbsp;to visit: morning or afternoon.&nbsp;Your   ticket will be&nbsp;for a single&nbsp;entry,&nbsp;in the morning, once your time is   done, the&nbsp;guards will ask&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave.</p>   <p><strong>Morning turn: 6AM &ndash; 12PM</strong></p>   <p><strong>Afternoon turn: 12PM &ndash; 5:30 PM</strong></p>   <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;If you have tickets to&nbsp;climb to Huayna Picchu   or Machu Picchu Mountain, you will have additional time until 2:30   PM.&nbsp;And you can re-enter for a single time as long as it is within the   time of re-entry (05 hours from the first entry)</p>   <p>If you want&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend all day at Machu Picchu, we can add a ticket&nbsp;for   the&nbsp;afternoon&nbsp;group&nbsp;to your reservation for $ 50 per person.</p>   <h3>Huayna Picchu / Machu Picchu Mountain</h3>   <p>Machu Picchu is more beautiful when viewed from above, so it is very   popular to hike one of the mountains next to the ruins after your guided   tour.</p>   <p>Huayna Picchu is the most popular and must be booked in advance &hellip; it   sells very fast.&nbsp;This hike takes approximately&nbsp;50&nbsp;minutes to the top   and&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes downhill to the bottom.&nbsp;There are 2 schedules or groups   to enter this mountain.&nbsp;The first group&nbsp;is 8-p am and&nbsp;the second&nbsp;is 10   am to 11 am.&nbsp;Again, this refers to when you can start your hike and   normally we reserve the second&nbsp;option&nbsp;so you can first enjoy your tour   with your guide&nbsp;in Machu Picchu.&nbsp;This walk will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;on your own, but   your guide will show you where to start.</p>   <p>The Machu Picchu mountain is a little longer and less popular.&nbsp;It   takes&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours to reach the top&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;hours to reach the bottom.&nbsp;There   are also 2 visiting hours: from 7-8 am and from 9 am to 10 am and we   usually buy&nbsp;for the second group.</p>   <h3>Health Concerns</h3>   <p>It is important that you be honest with your guide about any health   problems you may suffer.&nbsp;Although the guides are not medical   professionals, they are trained in first aid.&nbsp;We also work with a clinic   in Cusco that can help our team.</p>   <p>You are responsible for evaluating if a trek is suitable for you.&nbsp;You   should consult your doctor to confirm your physical condition to travel   and participate in any planned activity.&nbsp;You should seek advice from   your doctor about vaccinations and medical precautions.&nbsp;Peru Private   Tours will&nbsp;not provide medical advice.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to   assess the risks and requirements of each aspect of the Tour based on   your own circumstances, limitations, fitness level and medical   requirements.</p>   <p>If during the trek you get sick of extreme altitude or any other   illness that not allows you to continuing with the journey, but you want   to visit Machu Picchu by train, we will work with you to coordinate   this trip.&nbsp;This will be a new trip and may involve additional costs.&nbsp;We   will use as much of the logistics purchased from the original route to   keep rates low.</p>   <p>If you experience problems while walking and cannot continue, a   porter will escort you to the nearest road and wait while a car comes to   pick you up and take you to the nearest health clinic.</p>   <h3>Group trips</h3>   <p>Group tours are made up of different types of people, with different   walking skills and ages.&nbsp;By accepting a group trip, you understand that   some people may be slower or faster than you.&nbsp;Everyone can make their   own pace for the walk, the guide will work through the group to spend   time with everyone.&nbsp;Groups can request some modifications to the tour   and&nbsp;the&nbsp;guide will work with everyone to make the best decision for the   group.</p>   <h3>Strikes</h3>   <p>Unfortunately, strikes are very common in Peru and can cause many   interruptions in our Tours.&nbsp;Roads are often blocked, trains stopped.&nbsp;We   will do everything possible to operate your Tour, even before the&nbsp;start   date.&nbsp;Some tours may&nbsp;be canceled under these circumstances.&nbsp;Our   Operations Department will coordinate with you in this situation.&nbsp;Your   safety is always our main concern and will determine how we decide.</p>   <h3>Lost Items</h3>   <p>You are responsible for your personal items throughout the Tour.&nbsp;Be   diligent about where&nbsp;you&nbsp;leave your stuff and remember&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all   items from our vans,&nbsp;tents, restaurant, etc.&nbsp;Do not leave anything   involuntary while walking.&nbsp;Other hikers or teams can pick it up without   knowing to whom it belongs.</p>   <h3>Weather</h3>   <p>The climate in Cusco and Machu Picchu&nbsp;is unpredictable.&nbsp;In general,   the dry season in&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is from April to October, but this does not   prevent the rain from falling in June or the sun coming out in December,   just prepare for any weather condition.&nbsp;No matter which month you take   the hike or excursion, or which tour you are on, make sure you have   adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and   waterproof gloves.</p>   <p>Also be prepared for&nbsp;four seasons in a day.&nbsp;Many of the excursions   through the Andes involve many microclimates and you will have to be   prepared for all seasons.&nbsp;The layers are always key because they are   easy to adjust to different temperatures.&nbsp;And the nights will always be   cold, so get ready with a warm jacket.</p>   <h3>Altitude sickness</h3>   <p>As soon as the&nbsp;people reserve the trip to&nbsp;Peru, specifically   to&nbsp;Cusco, they begin to wonder about&nbsp;altitude sickness.&nbsp;High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.&nbsp;For few days at high altitude your   body adjusts to the least&nbsp;amount of oxygen in the air.</p>   <p>The&nbsp;first symptoms of altitude sickness&nbsp;may be;&nbsp;headache,   fatigue,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;loss of appetite, nausea or vomit, dizziness,   trouble sleeping, difficulty breathing during exercise.&nbsp;If any of these   effects worsen, contact our office and we will help you get to a doctor.</p>   <p>For farther info about altitude sicknes <a href=\"http://www.pptoursperu.com/altitud-sickness-in-cusco/\">CLIC

Delays occur frequently especially between October to March and it is   not uncommon for flights to be canceled. Make sure you arrive in the   city at least two days before the start date of your Tour to Machu   Picchu.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;is the most   reliable airline.&nbsp;Avianca and Peruvian Airlines&nbsp;are also acceptable   companies. You will not return from your tour on the last day until   around 22 pm So make sure your flight is not the day of the Machu Picchu   Tour, rather the next day.</li>   <li><strong>Tips</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Tips are always appreciated and should be   based entirely on your level of satisfaction.&nbsp;Although it may not be   usual for you, it has considerable importance for the people who will   assist you during your trips.</li>   <li><strong>Travel insurance.</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; To protect your travel   investment, we recommend to purchase&nbsp;a travel insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel   insurance before leaving home is highly recommended and very easy.&nbsp;There   are many insurance companies depending on your country of origin and at   different prices according to your time of stay, take some time to   review them and hire the one that best suits you.&nbsp;This is an excellent   way to protect yourself while visiting&nbsp;Peru.</li> </ul>', '<h3>Breafing (Previous Information)</h3>   <p>All information sessions are held in our office at 06:00 PM the night   before your trek.&nbsp;If you cannot assist to this talk please contact our   office staff to serve you better.</p>   <h3>Arriving to Cusco</h3>   <p>The airport in Cusco&nbsp;is currently&nbsp;quite small and only for domestic   flights, so all international travelers by plane must disembark   in&nbsp;Lima&nbsp;and go through Customs.&nbsp;Even if your flight to&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is the same   day by the same airline, you must pick up your bags in Lima and then   register them again.</p>   <p>The best way to get to Cusco is by air and there are several&nbsp;airline   options.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;tends to be the most expensive, but it   has&nbsp;more&nbsp;flight&nbsp;options.&nbsp;But you also have&nbsp;PERUVIAN, AVIANCA, STAR PERU,   LC PERU&nbsp;to choose according to your preference.&nbsp;Expect&nbsp;flight delays or   cancellations,&nbsp;due to the high&nbsp;altitude of Cusco, tends to be difficult   to land&nbsp;so that on rainy days you can paralyze&nbsp;air traffic.&nbsp;Bus   tours&nbsp;are always available and although the journey may be long,   especially from&nbsp;Lima,&nbsp;Peru buses&nbsp;are well maintained and are   comfortable.&nbsp;This option is recommended if you come from a city closer   to&nbsp;Cusco like Puno or Arequipa.&nbsp;Buses from Lima will take around 20   hours to arrive to Cusco.</p>   <h3>Pick Up from The Hotels.</h3>   <p>We pick up all our clients from the hotel for all tours.&nbsp;While your   hotel is in the center of the city of Cusco, we will coordinate this   pick up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;guide at the information session.&nbsp;Pick-up&nbsp;times&nbsp;may   vary between 20 and 30&nbsp;minutes depending on traffic conditions and   hotel&nbsp;locations.</p>   <p>Cusco is an ancient city with cobblestone streets and very narrow   corridors.&nbsp;Very small hotels and Air BNBs are often located on streets   that cars cannot pass through.&nbsp;They are also usually located on the side   of the hill, with long and steep climbs to the property, difficult to   maneuver with luggage.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not&nbsp;stay in one of these   places and try to find places where there is easy access to carry your   bags.</p>   <h3>Health Concerns</h3>   <p>It is important that you be honest with your guide about any health problems you may suffer.</p>   <p>You should seek advice from your doctor about vaccinations and   medical precautions.&nbsp;Peru Private Tours will&nbsp;not provide medical   advice.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to assess the risks and requirements   of each aspect of the Tour based on your own circumstances, limitations,   fitness level and medical requirements.</p>   <p>If during the trek you get sick of extreme altitude or any other   illness that not allows you to continuing with the journey, but you want   to visit Machu Picchu by train, we will work with you to coordinate   this trip.&nbsp;This will be a new trip and may involve additional costs.&nbsp;We   will use as much of the logistics purchased from the original route to   keep rates low.</p>   <p>If you experience problems while walking and cannot continue, a   porter will escort you to the nearest road and wait while a car comes to   pick you up and take you to the nearest health clinic.</p>   <h3>Group trips</h3>   <p>Group tours are made up of different types of people, with different   walking skills and ages.&nbsp;By accepting a group trip, you understand that   some people may be slower or faster than you.&nbsp;Everyone can make their   own pace for the walk, the guide will work through the group to spend   time with everyone.&nbsp;Groups can request some modifications to the tour   and&nbsp;the&nbsp;guide will work with everyone to make the best decision for the   group.</p>   <h3>Strikes</h3>   <p>Unfortunately, strikes are very common in Peru and can cause many   interruptions in our Tours.&nbsp;Roads are often blocked, trains stopped.&nbsp;We   will do everything possible to operate your Tour, even before the&nbsp;start   date.&nbsp;Some tours may&nbsp;be canceled under these circumstances.&nbsp;Our   Operations Department will coordinate with you in this situation.&nbsp;Your   safety is always our main concern and will determine how we decide.</p>   <h3>Lost Items</h3>   <p>You are responsible for your personal items throughout the Tour.&nbsp;Be   diligent about where&nbsp;you&nbsp;leave your stuff and remember&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all   items from our vans,&nbsp;tents, restaurant, etc.&nbsp;Do not leave anything   involuntary while walking.&nbsp;Other hikers or teams can pick it up without   knowing to whom it belongs.</p>   <h3>Weather</h3>   <p>The climate in Cusco and Machu Picchu&nbsp;is unpredictable.&nbsp;In general,   the dry season in&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is from April to October, but this does not   prevent the rain from falling in June or the sun coming out in December,   just prepare for any weather condition.&nbsp;No matter which month you take   the hike or excursion, or which tour you are on, make sure you have   adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and   waterproof gloves.</p>   <p>Also be prepared for&nbsp;four seasons in a day.&nbsp;Many of the excursions   through the Andes involve many microclimates and you will have to be   prepared for all seasons.&nbsp;The layers are always key because they are   easy to adjust to different temperatures.&nbsp;And the nights will always be   cold, so get ready with a warm jacket.</p>   <h3>Altitude sickness</h3>   <p>As soon as the&nbsp;people reserve the trip to&nbsp;Peru, specifically   to&nbsp;Cusco, they begin to wonder about&nbsp;altitude sickness.&nbsp;High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.&nbsp;For few days at high altitude your   body adjusts to the least&nbsp;amount of oxygen in the air.</p>   <p>The&nbsp;first symptoms of altitude sickness&nbsp;may be;&nbsp;headache,   fatigue,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;loss of appetite, nausea or vomit, dizziness,   trouble sleeping, difficulty breathing during exercise.&nbsp;If any of these   effects worsen, contact our office and we will help you get to a doctor.</p>   <p>for farther info about altitude sickness<a href=\"http://www.pptoursperu.com/altitud-sickness-in-cusco/\" target=\"_blank\"> CLIC HERE</a></p>   <h3>Travel

cannot assist to this talk please contact our   office staff to serve you better.</p>\n  <h3>Arrive in Cusco</h3>\n  <p>The best way to get to Cusco is by air and there are several&nbsp;airline   options.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;tends to be the most expensive, but it   has&nbsp;more&nbsp;flight&nbsp;options.&nbsp;But you also have&nbsp;PERUVIAN, AVIANCA, STAR PERU,   LC PERU&nbsp;to choose according to your preference.&nbsp;Expect&nbsp;flight delays or   cancellations,&nbsp;due to the high&nbsp;altitude of Cusco, tends to be difficult   to land&nbsp;so that on rainy days you can paralyze&nbsp;air traffic.&nbsp;Bus   tours&nbsp;are always available and although the journey may be long,   especially from&nbsp;Lima,&nbsp;Peru buses&nbsp;are well maintained and are   comfortable.&nbsp;This option is recommended if you come from a city closer   to&nbsp;Cusco like Puno or Arequipa.&nbsp;Buses from Lima will take around 20   hours to arrive to Cusco.</p>\n  <h3>Pick Up from The Hotels.</h3>\n  <p>We pick up all our clients from the hotel for all tours.&nbsp;While your   hotel is in the center of the city of Cusco, we will coordinate this   pick up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;guide at the information session.&nbsp;Pick-up&nbsp;times&nbsp;may   vary between 20 and 30&nbsp;minutes depending on traffic conditions and   hotel&nbsp;locations.</p>\n  <p>Cusco is an ancient city with cobblestone streets and very narrow   corridors.&nbsp;Very small hotels and Air BNBs are often located on streets   that cars cannot pass through.&nbsp;They are also usually located on the side   of the hill, with long and steep climbs to the property, difficult to   maneuver with luggage.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not&nbsp;stay in one of these   places and try to find places where there is easy access to carry your   bags.</p>\n  <h3>Leaving Machu Picchu requires a lot of logistics,&nbsp;but&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is&nbsp;included in your journey.</h3>\n  <p>From Machu Picchu&nbsp;Ruins&nbsp;to&nbsp;Machu Picchu Pueblo, you&nbsp;will take a   25-minute bus.&nbsp;The&nbsp;buses are in order of arrival and you can take any of   those in turn.</p>\n  <p>From Machu Picchu Pueblo,&nbsp;you will take a&nbsp;train&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ollantaytambo or   Poroy&nbsp;station.&nbsp;Your guide will give you your train tickets.&nbsp;Make sure   you get to the platform 30 minutes ahead of time.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo is 2 hours.</li>\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Poroy is 3.5 hours.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Once you arrive at the train station, look&nbsp;for our staff with a PPT sign.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will take you to the Plaza San Francisco, Cusco.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The trip on&nbsp;the van&nbsp;from Ollantaytambo to Plaza de San Francisco is 2 hours</li>\n    <li>Travel by&nbsp;van&nbsp;from Poroy to&nbsp;San Francisco Plaza is&nbsp;30 minutes</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Once you arrive at the Plaza San Francisco&nbsp;our staff will be waiting   for you to separate you and send in pre-paid taxis to your respective   hotels.</p>\n  <h3>Entrance fees to Machu Picchu</h3>\n  <p>Machu Picchu has now different schadules to visit: morning or   afternoon.&nbsp;Your ticket will be&nbsp;for a single&nbsp;entry,&nbsp;in the morning, once   your time is done, the&nbsp;guards will ask&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave.</p>\n  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;If you have tickets to&nbsp;climb to Huayna Picchu   or Machu Picchu Mountain, you will have additional time until 2:30   PM.&nbsp;And you can re-enter for a single time as long as it is within the   time of re-entry (05 hours from the first entry)</p>\n  <p>If you want&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend all day at Machu Picchu, we can add a ticket&nbsp;for   the&nbsp;afternoon&nbsp;group&nbsp;to your reservation for $ 50 per person.</p>\n  <h3>Huayna Picchu / Machu Picchu Mountain</h3>\n  <p>Machu Picchu is more beautiful when viewed from above, so it is very   popular to hike one of the mountains next to the ruins after your guided   tour.</p>\n  <p>Huayna Picchu is the most popular and must be booked in advance &hellip; it   sells very fast.&nbsp;This hike takes approximately&nbsp;50&nbsp;minutes to the top   and&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes downhill to the bottom.&nbsp;There are 2 schedules or groups   to enter this mountain.&nbsp;The first group&nbsp;is 8-p am and&nbsp;the second&nbsp;is 10   am to 11 am.&nbsp;Again, this refers to when you can start your hike and   normally we reserve the second&nbsp;option&nbsp;so you can first enjoy your tour   with your guide&nbsp;in Machu Picchu.&nbsp;This walk will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;on your own, but   your guide will show you where to start.</p>\n  <p>The Machu Picchu mountain is a little longer and less popular.&nbsp;It   takes&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours to reach the top&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;hours to reach the bottom.&nbsp;There   are also 2 visiting hours: from 7-8 am and from 9 am to 10 am and we   usually buy&nbsp;for the second group.</p>\n  <h3>Health Concerns</h3>\n  <p>It is important that you be honest with your guide about any health   problems you may suffer.&nbsp;Although the guides are not medical   professionals, they are trained in first aid.&nbsp;We also work with a clinic   in Cusco that can help our team.</p>\n  <p>You are responsible for evaluating if a trek is suitable for you.&nbsp;You   should consult your doctor to confirm your physical condition to travel   and participate in any planned activity.&nbsp;You should seek advice from   your doctor about vaccinations and medical precautions.&nbsp;Peru Private   Tours will&nbsp;not provide medical advice.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to   assess the risks and requirements of each aspect of the Tour based on   your own circumstances, limitations, fitness level and medical   requirements.</p>\n  <p>If during the trek you get sick of extreme altitude or any other   illness that not allows you to continuing with the journey, but you want   to visit Machu Picchu by train, we will work with you to coordinate   this trip.&nbsp;This will be a new trip and may involve additional costs.&nbsp;We   will use as much of the logistics purchased from the original route to   keep rates low.</p>\n  <p>If you experience problems while walking and cannot continue, a   porter will escort you to the nearest road and wait while a car comes to   pick you up and take you to the nearest health clinic.</p>\n  <h3>Group trips</h3>\n  <p>Group tours are made up of different types of people, with different   walking skills and ages.&nbsp;By accepting a group trip, you understand that   some people may be slower or faster than you.&nbsp;Everyone can make their   own pace for the walk, the guide will work through the group to spend   time with everyone.&nbsp;Groups can request some modifications to the tour   and&nbsp;the&nbsp;guide will work with everyone to make the best decision for the   group.</p>\n  <h3>Strikes</h3>\n  <p>Unfortunately, strikes are very common in Peru and can cause many   interruptions in our Tours.&nbsp;Roads are often blocked, trains stopped.&nbsp;We   will do everything possible to operate your Tour, even before the&nbsp;start   date.&nbsp;Some tours may&nbsp;be canceled under these circumstances.&nbsp;Our   Operations Department will coordinate with you in this situation.&nbsp;Your   safety is always our main concern and will determine how we decide.</p>\n  <h3>Lost Items</h3>\n  <p>You are responsible for your personal items throughout the Tour.&nbsp;Be   diligent about where&nbsp;you&nbsp;leave your stuff and remember&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all   items from our vans,&nbsp;tents, restaurant, etc.&nbsp;Do not leave anything   involuntary while walking.&nbsp;Other hikers or teams can pick it up without   knowing to whom it belongs.</p>\n  <h3>Weather</h3>\n  <p>The climate in Cusco and Machu Picchu&nbsp;is unpredictable.&nbsp;In general,   the dry season in&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is from April to October, but this does not   prevent the rain from falling in June or the sun coming out in December,   just prepare for any weather condition.&nbsp;No matter which month you take   the hike or excursion, or which tour you are on, make sure you have   adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and   waterproof gloves.</p>\n  <p>Also be prepared for&nbsp;four seasons in a day.&nbsp;Many of the excursions   through the Andes involve many microclimates and you will have to be   prepared for all seasons.&nbsp;The layers are always key because they are   easy to adjust to different temperatures.&nbsp;And the nights will always be   cold, so get ready with a warm jacket.</p>\n  <h3>Altitude sickness</h3>\n  <p>As soon as the&nbsp;people reserve the trip to&nbsp;Peru, specifically   to&nbsp;Cusco, they begin to wonder about&nbsp;altitude sickness.&nbsp;High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.&nbsp;For few days at high altitude your   body adjusts to the least&nbsp;amount of oxygen in the air.</p>\n  <p>The&nbsp;first symptoms of altitude sickness&nbsp;may be;&nbsp;headache,   fatigue,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;loss of appetite, nausea or vomit, dizziness,   trouble sleeping, difficulty breathing during exercise.&nbsp;If any of these   effects worsen, contact our office and we will help you get to a doctor.</p>\n  <p>For farther information about altitude sickness read our article <a href=\"http://www.pptoursperu.com/altitud-sickness-in-cusco/\">HERE</a></p>\n  <h3>Travel Insurance</h3>\n  <p>To protect your travel investment, we recommend buying&nbsp;travel   insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel insurance before leaving home is highly   recommended and very easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending   on your country of origin and at different

the evenings.&nbsp;There will be no lights on the camping sites   and it will be difficult to get to your dining tent or bathroom tent   without one.&nbsp;Hand lanterns are acceptable, if you do not have a head   lamp, but it makes some tasks difficult.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Huayna Picchu</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<strong>Huayna Picchu</strong> is   the mountain that is seen behind Machu Picchu in the classic photos, to   go up this mountain you need to buy an additional entrance and it has a   cost of $.&nbsp;35 dollars per person, however,&nbsp;this entrance must be   requested at the time of your reservation and it will be confirmed   according to availability of spaces as they only allow 200 people.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Flights.</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Flying to Cusco can be   complicated.&nbsp;Delays occur frequently especially between October to March   and it is not uncommon for flights to be canceled.&nbsp;Make sure you arrive   in the city at least two days before the start date of your trek to   Machu Picchu.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;is the most reliable airline.&nbsp;Avianca and Peruvian   Airlines&nbsp;are also acceptable companies.&nbsp;You will not return from your   tour on the last day until around 8 pm So make sure your flight is not   the day of the Machu Picchu Tour, rather the next day.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Tips</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Tips are always appreciated and should be   based entirely on your level of satisfaction.&nbsp;Although it may not be   usual for you, it has considerable importance to the people who will   assist you during

before leaving home is highly recommended and very   easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending on your country of   origin and at different prices according to your time of stay, take some   time to review them and hire the one that best suits you.&nbsp;This is an   excellent way to protect yourself while visiting&nbsp;Peru.</li>\r\n  </ul>', '  <h3>Breafing (Previous Information)</h3>\r\n  <p>All information sessions are held in our office at 06:00 PM the night   before your trek.&nbsp;If you cannot assist to this talk please contact our   office staff to serve you better.</p>\r\n  <h3>Arrive in Cusco</h3>\r\n  <p>The airport in Cusco&nbsp;is currently&nbsp;quite small and only for domestic   flights, so all international travelers by plane must disembark   in&nbsp;Lima&nbsp;and go through Customs.&nbsp;Even if your flight to&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is the same   day by the same airline, you must pick up your bags in Lima and then   register them again.</p>\r\n  <p>The best way to get to Cusco is by air and there are several&nbsp;airline   options.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;tends to be the most expensive, but it   has&nbsp;more&nbsp;flight&nbsp;options.&nbsp;But you also have&nbsp;PERUVIAN, AVIANCA, STAR PERU,   LC PERU&nbsp;to choose according to your preference.&nbsp;Expect&nbsp;flight delays or   cancellations,&nbsp;due to the high&nbsp;altitude of Cusco, tends to be difficult   to land&nbsp;so that on rainy days you can paralyze&nbsp;air traffic.&nbsp;Bus   tours&nbsp;are always available and although the journey may be long,   especially from&nbsp;Lima,&nbsp;Peru buses&nbsp;are well maintained and are   comfortable.&nbsp;This option is recommended if you come from a city closer   to&nbsp;Cusco like Puno or Arequipa.&nbsp;Buses from Lima will take around 20   hours to arrive to Cusco.</p>\r\n  <h3>Pick Up from The Hotels.</h3>\r\n  <p>We pick up all our clients from the hotel for all tours.&nbsp;While your   hotel is in the center of the city of Cusco, we will coordinate this   pick up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;guide at the information session.&nbsp;Pick-up&nbsp;times&nbsp;may   vary between 20 and 30&nbsp;minutes depending on traffic conditions and   hotel&nbsp;locations.</p>\r\n  <p>Cusco is an ancient city with cobblestone streets and very narrow   corridors.&nbsp;Very small hotels and Air BNBs are often located on streets   that cars cannot pass through.&nbsp;They are also usually located on the side   of the hill, with long and steep climbs to the property, difficult to   maneuver with luggage.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not&nbsp;stay in one of these   places and try to find places where there is easy access to carry your   bags.</p>\r\n  <h3>Leaving Machu <strong>Picchu</strong> requires a lot of logistics,&nbsp;but&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is&nbsp;included in your journey.</h3>\r\n  <p>From Machu Picchu&nbsp;Ruins&nbsp;to&nbsp;Machu Picchu Pueblo, you&nbsp;will take a   25-minute bus.&nbsp;The&nbsp;buses are in order of arrival and you can take any of   those in turn.</p>\r\n  <p>From Machu Picchu Pueblo,&nbsp;you will take a&nbsp;train&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ollantaytambo or   Poroy&nbsp;station.&nbsp;Your guide will give you your train tickets.&nbsp;Make sure   you get to the platform 30 minutes ahead of time.</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo is 2 hours.</li>\r\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Poroy is 3.5 hours.</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>Once you arrive at the train station, look&nbsp;for our staff with a PPT sign.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will take you to the Plaza San Francisco, Cusco.</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The trip on&nbsp;the van&nbsp;from Ollantaytambo to Plaza de San Francisco is 2 hours</li>\r\n    <li>Travel by&nbsp;van&nbsp;from Poroy to&nbsp;San Francisco Plaza is&nbsp;30 minutes</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>Once you arrive at the Plaza San Francisco&nbsp;our staff will be waiting   for you to separate you and send in pre-paid taxis to your respective   hotels.</p>\r\n  <h3>Entrance fees to Machu Picchu</h3>\r\n  <p>Machu Picchu now has two&nbsp;hours&nbsp;to visit: morning or afternoon.&nbsp;Your   ticket will be&nbsp;for a single&nbsp;entry,&nbsp;in the morning, once your time is   done, the&nbsp;guards will ask&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave.</p>\r\n  <p><strong>Morning turn: 6AM &ndash; 12PM</strong></p>\r\n  <p><strong>Afternoon turn: 12PM &ndash; 5:30 PM</strong></p>\r\n  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;If you have tickets to&nbsp;climb to Huayna Picchu   or Machu Picchu Mountain, you will have additional time until 2:30   PM.&nbsp;And you can re-enter for a single time as long as it is within the   time of re-entry (05 hours from the first entry)</p>\r\n  <p>If you want&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend all day at Machu Picchu, we can add a ticket&nbsp;for   the&nbsp;afternoon&nbsp;group&nbsp;to your reservation for $ 50 per person.</p>\r\n  <h3>Huayna Picchu / Machu Picchu Mountain</h3>\r\n  <p>Machu Picchu is more beautiful when viewed from above, so it is very   popular to hike one of the mountains next to the ruins after your guided   tour.</p>\r\n  <p>Huayna Picchu is the most popular and must be booked in advance &hellip; it   sells very fast.&nbsp;This hike takes approximately&nbsp;50&nbsp;minutes to the top   and&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes downhill to the bottom.&nbsp;There are 2 schedules or groups   to enter this mountain.&nbsp;The first group&nbsp;is 8-p am and&nbsp;the second&nbsp;is 10   am to 11 am.&nbsp;Again, this refers to when you can start your hike and   normally we reserve the second&nbsp;option&nbsp;so you can first enjoy your tour   with your guide&nbsp;in Machu Picchu.&nbsp;This walk will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;on your own, but   your guide will show you where to start.</p>\r\n  <p>The Machu Picchu mountain is a little longer and less popular.&nbsp;It   takes&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours to reach the top&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;hours to reach the bottom.&nbsp;There   are also 2 visiting hours: from 7-8 am and from 9 am to 10 am and we   usually buy&nbsp;for the second group.</p>\r\n  <h3>Health Concerns</h3>\r\n  <p>It is important that you be honest with your guide about any health   problems you may suffer.&nbsp;Although the guides are not medical   professionals, they are trained in first aid.&nbsp;We also work with a clinic   in Cusco that can help our team.</p>\r\n  <p>You are responsible for evaluating if a trek is suitable for you.&nbsp;You   should consult your doctor to confirm your physical condition to travel   and participate in any planned activity.&nbsp;You should seek advice from   your doctor about vaccinations and medical precautions.&nbsp;Peru Private   Tours will&nbsp;not provide medical advice.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to   assess the risks and requirements of each aspect of the Tour based on   your own circumstances, limitations, fitness level and medical   requirements.</p>\r\n  <p>If during the trek you get sick of extreme altitude or any other   illness that not allows you to continuing with the journey, but you want   to visit Machu Picchu by train, we will work with you to coordinate   this trip.&nbsp;This will be a new trip and may involve additional costs.&nbsp;We   will use as much of the logistics purchased from the original route to   keep rates low.</p>\r\n  <p>If you experience problems while walking and cannot continue, a   porter will escort you to the nearest road and wait while a car comes to   pick you up and take you to the nearest health clinic.</p>\r\n  <h3>Group trips</h3>\r\n  <p>Group tours are made up of different types of people, with different   walking skills and ages.&nbsp;By accepting a group trip, you understand that   some people may be slower or faster than you.&nbsp;Everyone can make their   own pace for the walk, the guide will work through the group to spend   time with everyone.&nbsp;Groups can request some modifications to the tour   and&nbsp;the&nbsp;guide will work with everyone to make the best decision for the   group.</p>\r\n  <h3>Strikes</h3>\r\n  <p>Unfortunately, strikes are very common in Peru and can cause many   interruptions in our Tours.&nbsp;Roads are often blocked, trains stopped.&nbsp;We   will do everything possible to operate your Tour, even before the&nbsp;start   date.&nbsp;Some tours may&nbsp;be canceled under these circumstances.&nbsp;Our   Operations Department will coordinate with you in this situation.&nbsp;Your   safety is always our main concern and will determine how we decide.</p>\r\n  <h3>Lost Items</h3>\r\n  <p>You are responsible for your personal items throughout the Tour.&nbsp;Be   diligent about where&nbsp;you&nbsp;leave your stuff and remember&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all   items from our vans,&nbsp;tents, restaurant, etc.&nbsp;Do not leave anything   involuntary while walking.&nbsp;Other hikers or teams can pick it up without   knowing to whom it belongs.</p>\r\n  <h3>Weather</h3>\r\n  <p>The climate in Cusco and Machu Picchu&nbsp;is unpredictable.&nbsp;In general,   the dry season in&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is from April to October, but this does not   prevent the rain from falling in June or the sun coming out in December,   just prepare for any weather condition.&nbsp;No matter which month you take   the hike or excursion, or which tour you are on, make sure you have   adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and   waterproof gloves.</p>\r\n  <p>Also be prepared for&nbsp;four seasons in a day.&nbsp;Many of the excursions   through the Andes involve many microclimates and you will have to be   prepared for all seasons.&nbsp;The layers are always key because they are   easy to adjust to different temperatures.&nbsp;And the nights will always be   cold, so get ready with a warm jacket.</p>\r\n  <h3>Altitude sickness</h3>\r\n  <p>As soon as the&nbsp;people reserve the trip to&nbsp;Peru, specifically   to&nbsp;Cusco, they begin to wonder about&nbsp;altitude sickness.&nbsp;High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.&nbsp;For few days at high altitude your   body adjusts to the least&nbsp;amount of oxygen in the air.</p>\r\n  <p>The&nbsp;first symptoms of altitude sickness&nbsp;may be;&nbsp;headache,   fatigue,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;loss of appetite, nausea or vomit, dizziness,   trouble sleeping, difficulty breathing during exercise.&nbsp;If any of these   effects worsen, contact our office and we will help you get to a doctor.</p>\r\n  <p>Most of the time, these symptoms will be mild.&nbsp;We always recommend   easy activities and walk&nbsp;slowly, allowing your body to adapt.&nbsp;Drink   plenty of fluids such as water or coca tea.&nbsp;Coca tea&nbsp;has been used since   ancient times to help prevent&nbsp;altitude&nbsp;sickness.&nbsp;The leaves&nbsp;of the coca   plant&nbsp;contain alkaloids that help carry oxygen to the blood, helping   your body avoid the effects of altitude sickness.&nbsp;Avoid drinking a lot   of alcohol and coffee because it will make you urinate more often and   you will become dehydrated.&nbsp;Avoid smoking,&nbsp;Smoking makes it difficult   for your body to get oxygen.&nbsp;Avoid sleeping pills.&nbsp;They can cause   shallow breathing at night, which makes it difficult for your body to   absorb oxygen while you sleep.</p>\r\n  <p>Many people prefer to visit the doctor to give them a treatment with   pills even before traveling to avoid problems during their stay.&nbsp;Your   doctor&nbsp;may prescribe medications, such   as&nbsp;acetazolamide&nbsp;and&nbsp;dexamethasone, to&nbsp;help&nbsp;prevent altitude   sickness.&nbsp;Start the medicine two days before reaching a high   altitude.&nbsp;Continue taking it while you are at high altitude.</p>\r\n  <h3>Travel <strong>insurance</strong></h3>\r\n  <p>To protect your travel investment, we recommend buying&nbsp;travel   insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel insurance before leaving home is highly   recommended and very easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending   on your country of origin and at different prices&nbsp;according to your time   of stay, take some time to review them and hire the one that best suits   you.&nbsp;This is an excellent way to&nbsp;protect yourself while visiting Peru.</p>\r\n  <h3><strong>Community</strong></h3>\r\n  <p>At&nbsp;Peru Private Tours (PPT)&nbsp;we are proud&nbsp;of the work we do for our   community.

while visiting&nbsp;Peru.</li>\r\n  </ul>', '  <h3>Breafing (Previous Information)</h3>   <p>All information sessions are held in our office at 06:00 PM the night   before your trek.&nbsp;If you cannot assist to this talk please contact our   office staff to serve you better.</p>   <h3>Duffle Bags</h3>   <p>You will receive your duffle bag at the information session.&nbsp;These   bags are to put your belongings inside it, these will be carried by the   porters and will be returned to you each evening at the   campsite.&nbsp;However, beside from these bags, you should carry a small   backpack where you will carry everything you need during the trek.</p>   <p>Each duffle bag must have a maximum weight of 7kg.&nbsp;4kg will be for   your clothes and other personal items, the other 3kg will be for our   logistics, such as your sleeping bag and pad, if you have your own   sleeping bag and mat these must be included in the 7 kilos.</p>   <h3>Arrive in Cusco</h3>   <p>The airport in Cusco&nbsp;is currently&nbsp;quite small and only for domestic   flights, so all international travelers by plane must disembark   in&nbsp;Lima&nbsp;and go through Customs.&nbsp;Even if your flight to&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is the same   day by the same airline, you must pick up your bags in Lima and then   register them again.</p>   <p>The bst way to get to Cusco is by air and there are several&nbsp;airline   options.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;tends to be the most expensive, but it   has&nbsp;more&nbsp;flight&nbsp;options.&nbsp;But you also have&nbsp;PERUVIAN, AVIANCA, STAR PERU,   LC PERU&nbsp;to choose according to your preference.&nbsp;Expect&nbsp;flight delays or   cancellations,&nbsp;due to the high&nbsp;altitude of Cusco, tends to be difficult   to land&nbsp;so that on rainy days you can paralyze&nbsp;air traffic.&nbsp;Bus   tours&nbsp;are always available and although the journey may be long,   especially from&nbsp;Lima,&nbsp;Peru buses&nbsp;are well maintained and are   comfortable.&nbsp;This option is recommended if you come from a city closer   to&nbsp;Cusco like Puno or Arequipa.&nbsp;Buses from Lima will take around 20   hours to arrive to Cusco.</p>   <h3>Pick Up from The Hotels.</h3>   <p>We pick up all our clients from the hotel for all tours.&nbsp;While your   hotel is in the center of the city of Cusco, we will coordinate this   pick up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;guide at the information session.&nbsp;Pick-up&nbsp;times&nbsp;may   vary between 20 and 30&nbsp;minutes depending on traffic conditions and   hotel&nbsp;locations.</p>   <p>Cusco is an ancient city with cobblestone streets and very narrow   corridors.&nbsp;Very small hotels and Air BNBs are often located on streets   that cars cannot pass through.&nbsp;They are also usually located on the side   of the hill, with long and steep climbs to the property, difficult to   maneuver with luggage.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not&nbsp;stay in one of these   places and try to find places where there is easy access to carry your   bags.</p>   <h3>Leaving Machu Picchu requires a lot of logistics,&nbsp;but&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is&nbsp;included in your journey.</h3>   <p>From Machu Picchu&nbsp;Ruins&nbsp;to&nbsp;Machu Picchu Pueblo, you&nbsp;will take a   25-minute bus.&nbsp;The&nbsp;buses are in order of arrival and you can take any of   those in turn.</p>   <p>From Machu Picchu Pueblo,&nbsp;you will take a&nbsp;train&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ollantaytambo or   Poroy&nbsp;station.&nbsp;Your guide will give you your train tickets.&nbsp;Make sure   you get to the platform 30 minutes ahead of time.</p>   <ul>     <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo is 2 hours.</li>     <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Poroy is 3.5 hours.</li>   </ul>   <p>Once you arrive at the train station, look&nbsp;for our staff with a PPT sign.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will take you to the Plaza San Francisco, Cusco.</p>   <ul>     <li>The trip on&nbsp;the van&nbsp;from Ollantaytambo to Plaza de San Francisco is 2 hours</li>     <li>Travel by&nbsp;van&nbsp;from Poroy to&nbsp;San Francisco Plaza is&nbsp;30 minutes</li>   </ul>   <p>Once you arrive at the Plaza San Francisco&nbsp;our staff will be waiting   for you to separate you and send in pre-paid taxis to your respective   hotels.</p>   <h3>Entrance fees to Machu Picchu</h3>   <p>Machu Picchu now has two&nbsp;hours&nbsp;to visit: morning or afternoon.&nbsp;Your   ticket will be&nbsp;for a single&nbsp;entry,&nbsp;in the morning, once your time is   done, the&nbsp;guards will ask&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave.</p>   <p><strong>Morning turn: 6AM &ndash; 12PM</strong></p>   <p><strong>Afternoon turn: 12PM &ndash; 5:30 PM</strong></p>   <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;If you have tickets to&nbsp;climb to Huayna Picchu   or Machu Picchu Mountain, you will have additional time until 2:30   PM.&nbsp;And you can re-enter for a single time as long as it is within the   time of re-entry (05 hours from the first entry)</p>   <p>If you want&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend all day at Machu Picchu, we can add a ticket&nbsp;for   the&nbsp;afternoon&nbsp;group&nbsp;to your reservation for $ 50 per person.</p>   <h3>Huayna Picchu / Machu Picchu Mountain</h3>   <p>Machu Picchu is more beautiful when viewed from above, so it is very   popular to hike one of the mountains next to the ruins after your guided   tour.</p>   <p>Huayna Picchu is the most popular and must be booked in advance &hellip; it   sells very fast.&nbsp;This hike takes approximately&nbsp;50&nbsp;minutes to the top   and&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes downhill to the bottom.&nbsp;There are 2 schedules or groups   to enter this mountain.&nbsp;The first group&nbsp;is 8-p am and&nbsp;the second&nbsp;is 10   am to 11 am.&nbsp;Again, this refers to when you can start your hike and   normally we reserve the second&nbsp;option&nbsp;so you can first enjoy your tour   with your guide&nbsp;in Machu Picchu.&nbsp;This walk will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;on your own, but   your guide will show you where to start.</p>   <p>The Machu Picchu mountain is a little longer and less popular.&nbsp;It   takes&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours to reach the top&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;hours to reach the bottom.&nbsp;There   are also 2 visiting hours: from 7-8 am and from 9 am to 10 am and we   usually buy&nbsp;for the second group.</p>   <h3>Health Concerns</h3>   <p>It is important that you be honest with your guide about any health   problems you may suffer.&nbsp;Although the guides are not medical   professionals, they are trained in first aid.&nbsp;We also work with a clinic   in Cusco that can help our team.</p>   <p>You are responsible for evaluating if a trek is suitable for you.&nbsp;You   should consult your doctor to confirm your physical condition to travel   and participate in any planned activity.&nbsp;You should seek advice from   your doctor about vaccinations and medical precautions.&nbsp;Peru Private   Tours will&nbsp;not provide medical advice.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to   assess the risks and requirements of each aspect of the Tour based on   your own circumstances, limitations, fitness level and medical   requirements.</p>   <p>If during the trek you get sick of extreme altitude or any other   illness that not allows you to continuing with the journey, but you want   to visit Machu Picchu by train, we will work with you to coordinate   this trip.&nbsp;This will be a new trip and may involve additional costs.&nbsp;We   will use as much of the logistics purchased from the original route to   keep rates low.</p>   <p>If you experience problems while walking and cannot continue, a   porter will escort you to the nearest road and wait while a car comes to   pick you up and take you to the nearest health clinic.</p>   <h3>Group trips</h3>   <p>Group tours are made up of different types of people, with different   walking skills and ages.&nbsp;By accepting a group trip, you understand that   some people may be slower or faster than you.&nbsp;Everyone can make their   own pace for the walk, the guide will work through the group to spend   time with everyone.&nbsp;Groups can request some modifications to the tour   and&nbsp;the&nbsp;guide will work with everyone to make the best decision for the   group.</p>   <h3>Strikes</h3>   <p>Unfortunately, strikes are very common in Peru and can cause many   interruptions in our Tours.&nbsp;Roads are often blocked, trains stopped.&nbsp;We   will do everything possible to operate your Tour, even before the&nbsp;start   date.&nbsp;Some tours may&nbsp;be canceled under these circumstances.&nbsp;Our   Operations Department will coordinate with you in this situation.&nbsp;Your   safety is always our main concern and will determine how we decide.</p>   <h3>Lost Items</h3>   <p>You are responsible for your personal items throughout the Tour.&nbsp;Be   diligent about where&nbsp;you&nbsp;leave your stuff and remember&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all   items from our vans,&nbsp;tents, restaurant, etc.&nbsp;Do not leave anything   involuntary while walking.&nbsp;Other hikers or teams can pick it up without   knowing to whom it belongs.</p>   <h3>Weather</h3>   <p>The climate in Cusco and Machu Picchu&nbsp;is unpredictable.&nbsp;In general,   the dry season in&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is from April to October, but this does not   prevent the rain from falling in June or the sun coming out in December,   just prepare for any weather condition.&nbsp;No matter which month you take   the hike or excursion, or which tour you are on, make sure you have   adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and   waterproof gloves.</p>   <p>Also be prepared for&nbsp;four seasons in a day.&nbsp;Many of the excursions   through the Andes involve many microclimates and you will have to be   prepared for all seasons.&nbsp;The layers are always key because they are   easy to adjust to different temperatures.&nbsp;And the nights will always be   cold, so get ready with a warm jacket.</p>   <h3>Altitude sickness</h3>   <p>As soon as the&nbsp;people reserve the trip to&nbsp;Peru, specifically   to&nbsp;Cusco, they begin to wonder about&nbsp;altitude sickness.&nbsp;High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.&nbsp;For few days at high altitude your   body adjusts to the least&nbsp;amount of oxygen in the air.</p>   <p>The&nbsp;first symptoms of altitude sickness&nbsp;may be;&nbsp;headache,   fatigue,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;loss of appetite, nausea or vomit, dizziness,   trouble sleeping, difficulty breathing during exercise.&nbsp;If any of these   effects worsen, contact our office and we will help you get to a doctor.</p>   <p>For farther information about altitude sicknes clic <a href=\"http://www.pptoursperu.com/altitude-sickness-in-cusco/\">HERE</a></p>   <h3>Travel insurance</h3>   <p>To protect your travel investment, we recommend buying&nbsp;travel   insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel insurance before leaving home is highly   recommended and very easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending   on your country of origin and at different prices&nbsp;according to your time   of stay, take some time to review them and hire the one that best suits   you.&nbsp;This is an excellent way to&nbsp;protect yourself while visiting Peru.</p>   <h3>Community</h3>   <p>At&nbsp;Peru Private Tours (PPT)&nbsp;we are proud&nbsp;of the work we do for our   community.

High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.</p> <p>In our rainbow mountain tour in the afternoon we will always have   oxygen tank and first aid kit, our guides all well trained to assist you   in case you have any altitude sympthom.</p> <p>For farther information about altitude sickness please read our article <a href=\"http://www.pptoursperu.com/en/altitud-sickness/\">HERE.</a></p> <h3>Weather</h3> <p>The weather in the Sacred Valley is unpredictable. Dry season in   Cusco is from April through October, but this does not prevent the rain   from falling in June or the sun coming out in December, just be prepared   for any weather.</p> <p>Make sure you have adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and waterproof gloves.</p> <h3>Arriving to Cusco</h3> <p>The best way to get to Cusco is by air and there are several&nbsp;airline options.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latam.com/en_us/\">LATAM</a> tends to be the most expensive, but it has more flight options.</p> <p>Expect&nbsp;flight delays or cancellations,&nbsp;due to the high&nbsp;altitude of   Cusco, tends to be difficult to land&nbsp;so that on rainy days you can   paralyze&nbsp;air traffic.</p> <h3>Travel insurance</h3> <p>To protect your travel investment, we recommend buying travel   insurance. Getting travel insurance before leaving home is highly   recommended and very easy.</p> <p>There are many insurance companies depending on your country of   origin and at different prices according to your time of stay, take some   time to review them and hire the one that best suits you. However, this   is an excellent way to protect yourself while visiting Peru.</p> <h3>Community</h3> <p>At&nbsp;Peru Private Tours (PPT)&nbsp;we are proud&nbsp;of the work we do for our community.&nbsp;This   is&nbsp;the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objective&nbsp;for our company.&nbsp;We are working&nbsp;directly with the   villages to help them meet the needs of their families.&nbsp;We support the   children of the villages by giving them&nbsp;school supplies,&nbsp;books&nbsp;and   clothes.</p> <p>PPT offers constant training for all our team.

uncommon for flights to be canceled.&nbsp;Make sure you arrive   in the city at least two days before the start date of your trek to   Machu Picchu.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;is the most reliable airline.&nbsp;Avianca and Peruvian   Airlines&nbsp;are also acceptable companies.&nbsp;You will not return from your   tour on the last day until around 8 pm So make sure your flight is not   the day

best suits you.&nbsp;This is an   excellent way to protect yourself while visiting&nbsp;Peru.</li>\r\n  </ul>', '  <h3>Breafing (Previous Information)</h3>\r\n  <p>All information sessions are held in our office at 06:00 PM the night   before your trek.&nbsp;If you cannot assist to this talk please contact our   office staff to serve you better.</p>\r\n  <h3>Duffle Bags</h3>\r\n  <p>You will receive your duffle bag at the information session.&nbsp;These   bags are to put your belongings inside it, these will be carried by the   porters and will be returned to you each evening at the   campsite.&nbsp;However, beside from these bags, you should carry a small   backpack where you will carry everything you need during the trek.</p>\r\n  <p>Each duffle bag must have a maximum weight of 7kg.&nbsp;4kg will be for   your clothes and other personal items, the other 3kg will be for our   logistics, such as your sleeping bag and pad, if you have your own   sleeping bag and mat these must be included in the 7 kilos.</p>\r\n  <h3>Arrive in Cusco</h3>\r\n  <p>The airport in Cusco&nbsp;is currently&nbsp;quite small and only for domestic   flights, so all international travelers by plane must disembark   in&nbsp;Lima&nbsp;and go through Customs.&nbsp;Even if your flight to&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is the same   day by the same airline, you must pick up your bags in Lima and then   register them again.</p>\r\n  <p>The best way to get to Cusco is by air and there are several&nbsp;airline   options.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;tends to be the most expensive, but it   has&nbsp;more&nbsp;flight&nbsp;options.&nbsp;But you also have&nbsp;PERUVIAN, AVIANCA, STAR PERU,   LC PERU&nbsp;to choose according to your preference.&nbsp;Expect&nbsp;flight delays or   cancellations,&nbsp;due to the high&nbsp;altitude of Cusco, tends to be difficult   to land&nbsp;so that on rainy days you can paralyze&nbsp;air traffic.&nbsp;Bus   tours&nbsp;are always available and although the journey may be long,   especially from&nbsp;Lima,&nbsp;Peru buses&nbsp;are well maintained and are   comfortable.&nbsp;This option is recommended if you come from a city closer   to&nbsp;Cusco like Puno or Arequipa.&nbsp;Buses from Lima will take around 20   hours to arrive to Cusco.</p>\r\n  <h3>Pick Up from The Hotels.</h3>\r\n  <p>We pick up all our clients from the hotel for all tours.&nbsp;While your   hotel is in the center of the city of Cusco, we will coordinate this   pick up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;guide at the information session.&nbsp;Pick-up&nbsp;times&nbsp;may   vary between 20 and 30&nbsp;minutes depending on traffic conditions and   hotel&nbsp;locations.</p>\r\n  <p>Cusco is an ancient city with cobblestone streets and very narrow   corridors.&nbsp;Very small hotels and Air BNBs are often located on streets   that cars cannot pass through.&nbsp;They are also usually located on the side   of the hill, with long and steep climbs to the property, difficult to   maneuver with luggage.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not&nbsp;stay in one of these   places and try to find places where there is easy access to carry your   bags.</p>\r\n  <h3>Leaving Machu Picchu requires a lot of logistics,&nbsp;but&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is&nbsp;included in your journey.</h3>\r\n  <p>From Machu Picchu&nbsp;Ruins&nbsp;to&nbsp;Machu Picchu Pueblo, you&nbsp;will take a   25-minute bus.&nbsp;The&nbsp;buses are in order of arrival and you can take any of   those in turn.</p>\r\n  <p>From Machu Picchu Pueblo,&nbsp;you will take a&nbsp;train&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ollantaytambo or   Poroy&nbsp;station.&nbsp;Your guide will give you your train tickets.&nbsp;Make sure   you get to the platform 30 minutes ahead of time.</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo is 2 hours.</li>\r\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Poroy is 3.5 hours.</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>Once you arrive at the train station, look&nbsp;for our staff with a PPT sign.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will take you to the Plaza San Francisco, Cusco.</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The trip on&nbsp;the van&nbsp;from Ollantaytambo to Plaza de San Francisco is 2 hours</li>\r\n    <li>Travel by&nbsp;van&nbsp;from Poroy to&nbsp;San Francisco Plaza is&nbsp;30 minutes</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>Once you arrive at the Plaza San Francisco&nbsp;our staff will be waiting   for you to separate you and send in pre-paid taxis to your respective   hotels.</p>\r\n  <h3>Entrance fees to Machu Picchu</h3>\r\n  <p>Machu Picchu now has two&nbsp;hours&nbsp;to visit: morning or afternoon.&nbsp;Your   ticket will be&nbsp;for a single&nbsp;entry,&nbsp;in the morning, once your time is   done, the&nbsp;guards will ask&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave.</p>\r\n  <p><strong>Morning turn: 6AM &ndash; 12PM</strong></p>\r\n  <p><strong>Afternoon turn: 12PM &ndash; 5:30 PM</strong></p>\r\n  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;If you have tickets to&nbsp;climb to Huayna Picchu   or Machu Picchu Mountain, you will have additional time until 2:30   PM.&nbsp;And you can re-enter for a single time as long as it is within the   time of re-entry (05 hours from the first entry)</p>\r\n  <p>If you want&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend all day at Machu Picchu, we can add a ticket&nbsp;for   the&nbsp;afternoon&nbsp;group&nbsp;to your reservation for $ 50 per person.</p>\r\n  <p><strong>Huayna Picchu / Machu Picchu Mountain</strong></p>\r\n  <p>Machu Picchu is more beautiful when viewed from above, so it is very   popular to hike one of the mountains next to the ruins after your guided   tour.</p>\r\n  <p>Huayna Picchu is the most popular and must be booked in advance &hellip; it   sells very fast.&nbsp;This hike takes approximately&nbsp;50&nbsp;minutes to the top   and&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes downhill to the bottom.&nbsp;There are 2 schedules or groups   to enter this mountain.&nbsp;The first group&nbsp;is 8-p am and&nbsp;the second&nbsp;is 10   am to 11 am.&nbsp;Again, this refers to when you can start your hike and   normally we reserve the second&nbsp;option&nbsp;so you can first enjoy your tour   with your guide&nbsp;in Machu Picchu.&nbsp;This walk will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;on your own, but   your guide will show you where to start.</p>\r\n  <p>The Machu Picchu mountain is a little longer and less popular.&nbsp;It   takes&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours to reach the top&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;hours to reach the bottom.&nbsp;There   are also 2 visiting hours: from 7-8 am and from 9 am to 10 am and we   usually buy&nbsp;for the second group.</p>\r\n  <h3>Health Concerns</h3>\r\n  <p>It is important that you be honest with your guide about any health   problems you may suffer.&nbsp;Although the guides are not medical   professionals, they are trained in first aid.&nbsp;We also work with a clinic   in Cusco that can help our team.</p>\r\n  <p>You are responsible for evaluating if a trek is suitable for you.&nbsp;You   should consult your doctor to confirm your physical condition to travel   and participate in any planned activity.&nbsp;You should seek advice from   your doctor about vaccinations and medical precautions.&nbsp;Peru Private   Tours will&nbsp;not provide medical advice.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to   assess the risks and requirements of each aspect of the Tour based on   your own circumstances, limitations, fitness level and medical   requirements.</p>\r\n  <p>If during the trek you get sick of extreme altitude or any other   illness that not allows you to continuing with the journey, but you want   to visit Machu Picchu by train, we will work with you to coordinate   this trip.&nbsp;This will be a new trip and may involve additional costs.&nbsp;We   will use as much of the logistics purchased from the original route to   keep rates low.</p>\r\n  <p>If you experience problems while walking and cannot continue, a   porter will escort you to the nearest road and wait while a car comes to   pick you up and take you to the nearest health clinic.</p>\r\n  <h3>Group trips</h3>\r\n  <p>Group tours are made up of different types of people, with different   walking skills and ages.&nbsp;By accepting a group trip, you understand that   some people may be slower or faster than you.&nbsp;Everyone can make their   own pace for the walk, the guide will work through the group to spend   time with everyone.&nbsp;Groups can request some modifications to the tour   and&nbsp;the&nbsp;guide will work with everyone to make the best decision for the   group.</p>\r\n  <h3>Strikes</h3>\r\n  <p>Unfortunately, strikes are very common in Peru and can cause many   interruptions in our Tours.&nbsp;Roads are often blocked, trains stopped.&nbsp;We   will do everything possible to operate your Tour, even before the&nbsp;start   date.&nbsp;Some tours may&nbsp;be canceled under these circumstances.&nbsp;Our   Operations Department will coordinate with you in this situation.&nbsp;Your   safety is always our main concern and will determine how we decide.</p>\r\n  <h3>Lost Items</h3>\r\n  <p>You are responsible for your personal items throughout the Tour.&nbsp;Be   diligent about where&nbsp;you&nbsp;leave your stuff and remember&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all   items from our vans,&nbsp;tents, restaurant, etc.&nbsp;Do not leave anything   involuntary while walking.&nbsp;Other hikers or teams can pick it up without   knowing to whom it belongs.</p>\r\n  <h3>Weather</h3>\r\n  <p>The climate in Cusco and Machu Picchu&nbsp;is unpredictable.&nbsp;In general,   the dry season in&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is from April to October, but this does not   prevent the rain from falling in June or the sun coming out in December,   just prepare for any weather condition.&nbsp;No matter which month you take   the hike or excursion, or which tour you are on, make sure you have   adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and   waterproof gloves.</p>\r\n  <p>Also be prepared for&nbsp;four seasons in a day.&nbsp;Many of the excursions   through the Andes involve many microclimates and you will have to be   prepared for all seasons.&nbsp;The layers are always key because they are   easy to adjust to different temperatures.&nbsp;And the nights will always be   cold, so get ready with a warm jacket.</p>\r\n  <h3>Altitude sickness</h3>\r\n  <p>As soon as the&nbsp;people reserve the trip to&nbsp;Peru, specifically   to&nbsp;Cusco, they begin to wonder about&nbsp;altitude sickness.&nbsp;High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.&nbsp;For few days at high altitude your   body adjusts to the least&nbsp;amount of oxygen in the air.</p>\r\n  <p>The&nbsp;first symptoms of altitude sickness&nbsp;may be;&nbsp;headache,   fatigue,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;loss of appetite, nausea or vomit, dizziness,   trouble sleeping, difficulty breathing during exercise.&nbsp;If any of these   effects worsen, contact our office and we will help you get to a doctor.</p>\r\n  <p>Most of the time, these symptoms will be mild.&nbsp;We always recommend   easy activities and walk&nbsp;slowly, allowing your body to adapt.&nbsp;Drink   plenty of fluids such as water or coca tea.&nbsp;Coca tea&nbsp;has been used since   ancient times to help prevent&nbsp;altitude&nbsp;sickness.&nbsp;The leaves&nbsp;of the coca   plant&nbsp;contain alkaloids that help carry oxygen to the blood, helping   your body avoid the effects of altitude sickness.&nbsp;Avoid drinking a lot   of alcohol and coffee because it will make you urinate more often and   you will become dehydrated.&nbsp;Avoid smoking,&nbsp;Smoking makes it difficult   for your body to get oxygen.&nbsp;Avoid sleeping pills.&nbsp;They can cause   shallow breathing at night, which makes it difficult for your body to   absorb oxygen while you sleep.</p>\r\n  <p>Many people prefer to visit the doctor to give them a treatment with   pills even before traveling to avoid problems during their stay.&nbsp;Your   doctor&nbsp;may prescribe medications, such   as&nbsp;acetazolamide&nbsp;and&nbsp;dexamethasone, to&nbsp;help&nbsp;prevent altitude   sickness.&nbsp;Start the medicine two days before reaching a high   altitude.&nbsp;Continue taking it while you are at high altitude.</p>\r\n  <h3>Travel insurance</h3>\r\n  <p>To protect your travel investment, we recommend buying&nbsp;travel   insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel insurance before leaving home is highly   recommended and very easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending   on your country of origin and at different prices&nbsp;according to your time   of stay, take some time to review them and hire the one that best suits   you.&nbsp;This is an excellent way to&nbsp;protect yourself while visiting Peru.</p>\r\n  <h3>Community</h3>\r\n  <p>At&nbsp;Peru Private Tours (PPT)&nbsp;we are proud&nbsp;of the work we do for our   community. This is&nbsp;the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objective&nbsp;for our company.&nbsp;We are   working&nbsp;directly with the villages to help them meet the needs of their   families.&nbsp;We support the children of the villages by giving them&nbsp;school   supplies,&nbsp;books&nbsp;and clothes.</p>\r\n  <p>We buy all our food from farmers and local markets and serve the   freshest ingredients.&nbsp;We offer&nbsp;constant training&nbsp;for all our team:   guides, porters, chefs and drivers.&nbsp;We are a family born in the Andes   and we want to work with them and for them.&nbsp;That is why once&nbsp;a year we   bring our porters and their families to&nbsp;Machu&nbsp;Picchu.&nbsp;We want our team   to know the world wonder, since they work tirelessly at the doors of   this place without ever visiting it and&nbsp;showing them this place is our   greatest honor.</p>', '', 'salkantay-trek', 0, '', 0, 0, 499.00, 0, '4 days / 3 nights', 0, 0, 0, '<button class=\"wtrvl-checkout_button\" id=\"wetravel_button_widget\" data-env=\"https://www.wetravel.com\" data-version=\"v0.3\" data-uid=\"1162090\" data-uuid=\"94789504\" href=\"https://www.wetravel.com/checkout_embed?uuid=94789504\" style=\"background-color:#33ae3f;color:#ffffff;border: 0px;border-radius: 5px;font-family: \'Poppins\', sans-serif;font-weight: 400;font-size: 14px;-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;text-transform: capitalize;padding: 13px 24px;text-decoration: none;text-align: center;line-height: 14px;display: inline-block; cursor: pointer;\">Book Now</button><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins\" rel=\"stylesheet\"><script src=\"https://cdn.wetravel.com/widgets/embed_checkout.js\"></script>', 7, 4),

<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>headlamps:</strong> it&nbsp;is strongly recommended to bring a   head lamp for the evenings.&nbsp;There will be no lights on the camping sites   and it will be difficult to get to your dining tent or bathroom tent   without one.&nbsp;Hand lanterns are acceptable, if you do not have a head   lamp, but it makes some tasks difficult.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Huayna Picchu</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<strong>Huayna Picchu</strong> is   the mountain that is seen behind Machu Picchu in the classic photos, to   go up this mountain you need to buy an additional entrance and it has a   cost of $.&nbsp;35 dollars per person, however,&nbsp;this entrance must be   requested at the time of your reservation and it will be confirmed   according to availability of spaces as they only allow 200 people.</li>\r\n    <li>&nbsp;<strong>Flights.</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Flying to Cusco can be   complicated.&nbsp;Delays occur frequently especially between October to March   and it is not uncommon for flights to be canceled.&nbsp;Make sure you arrive   in the city at least two days before the start date of your trek to   Machu Picchu.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;is the most reliable airline.&nbsp;Avianca and Peruvian   Airlines&nbsp;are also acceptable companies.&nbsp;You will not return from your   tour on the last day until around 8 pm So make sure your flight is not   the day of the Machu Picchu Tour, rather the next day.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Tips</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Tips are always appreciated and should be   based entirely on your level of satisfaction.&nbsp;Although it may not be   usual for you, it has considerable importance to the people who will   assist you during your trek.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Travel insurance.</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; To protect your travel   investment, we recommend the purchase&nbsp;a travel insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel   insurance before leaving home is highly recommended and very   easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending on your country of   origin and at different prices according to your time of stay, take some   time to review them and hire the one that best suits you.&nbsp;This is an   excellent way to protect yourself while visiting&nbsp;Peru.</li>\r\n  </ul>', '  <h3>Breafing (Previous Information)</h3>\r\n  <p>All information sessions are held in our office at 06:00 PM the night   before your trek.&nbsp;If you cannot assist to this talk please contact our   office staff to serve you better.</p>\r\n  <h3>Duffle Bags</h3>\r\n  <p>You will receive your duffle bag at the information session.&nbsp;These   bags are to put your belongings inside it, these will be carried by the   porters and will be returned to you each evening at the   campsite.&nbsp;However, beside from these bags, you should carry a small   backpack where you will carry everything you need during the trek.</p>\r\n  <p>Each duffle bag must have a maximum weight of 7kg.&nbsp;4kg will be for   your clothes and other personal items, the other 3kg will be for our   logistics, such as your sleeping bag and pad, if you have your own   sleeping bag and mat these must be included in the 7 kilos.</p>\r\n  <h3>Arrive in Cusco</h3>\r\n  <p>The airport in Cusco&nbsp;is currently&nbsp;quite small and only for domestic   flights, so all international travelers by plane must disembark   in&nbsp;Lima&nbsp;and go through Customs.&nbsp;Even if your flight to&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is the same   day by the same airline, you must pick up your bags in Lima and then   register them again.</p>\r\n  <p>The best way to get to Cusco is by air and there are several&nbsp;airline   options.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;tends to be the most expensive, but it   has&nbsp;more&nbsp;flight&nbsp;options.&nbsp;But you also have&nbsp;PERUVIAN, AVIANCA, STAR PERU,   LC PERU&nbsp;to choose according to your preference.&nbsp;Expect&nbsp;flight delays or   cancellations,&nbsp;due to the high&nbsp;altitude of Cusco, tends to be difficult   to land&nbsp;so that on rainy days you can paralyze&nbsp;air traffic.&nbsp;Bus   tours&nbsp;are always available and although the journey may be long,   especially from&nbsp;Lima,&nbsp;Peru buses&nbsp;are well maintained and are   comfortable.&nbsp;This option is recommended if you come from a city closer   to&nbsp;Cusco like Puno or Arequipa.&nbsp;Buses from Lima will take around 20   hours to arrive to Cusco.</p>\r\n  <h3>Pick Up from The Hotels.</h3>\r\n  <p>We pick up all our clients from the hotel for all tours.&nbsp;While your   hotel is in the center of the city of Cusco, we will coordinate this   pick up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;guide at the information session.&nbsp;Pick-up&nbsp;times&nbsp;may   vary between 20 and 30&nbsp;minutes depending on traffic conditions and   hotel&nbsp;locations.</p>\r\n  <p>Cusco is an ancient city with cobblestone streets and very narrow   corridors.&nbsp;Very small hotels and Air BNBs are often located on streets   that cars cannot pass through.&nbsp;They are also usually located on the side   of the hill, with long and steep climbs to the property, difficult to   maneuver with luggage.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not&nbsp;stay in one of these   places and try to find places where there is easy access to carry your   bags.</p>\r\n  <h3>Leaving Machu Picchu requires a lot of logistics,&nbsp;but&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is&nbsp;included in your journey.</h3>\r\n  <p>From Machu Picchu&nbsp;Ruins&nbsp;to&nbsp;Machu Picchu Pueblo, you&nbsp;will take a   25-minute bus.&nbsp;The&nbsp;buses are in order of arrival and you can take any of   those in turn.</p>\r\n  <p>From Machu Picchu Pueblo,&nbsp;you will take a&nbsp;train&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ollantaytambo or   Poroy&nbsp;station.&nbsp;Your guide will give you your train tickets.&nbsp;Make sure   you get to the platform 30 minutes ahead of time.</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo is 2 hours.</li>\r\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Poroy is 3.5 hours.</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>Once you arrive at the train station, look&nbsp;for our staff with a PPT sign.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will take you to the Plaza San Francisco, Cusco.</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The trip on&nbsp;the van&nbsp;from Ollantaytambo to Plaza de San Francisco is 2 hours</li>\r\n    <li>Travel by&nbsp;van&nbsp;from Poroy to&nbsp;San Francisco Plaza is&nbsp;30 minutes</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>Once you arrive at the Plaza San Francisco&nbsp;our staff will be waiting   for you to separate you and send in pre-paid taxis to your respective   hotels.</p>\r\n  <h3>Entrance fees to Machu Picchu</h3>\r\n  <p>Machu Picchu now has two&nbsp;hours&nbsp;to visit: morning or afternoon.&nbsp;Your   ticket will be&nbsp;for a single&nbsp;entry,&nbsp;in the morning, once your time is   done, the&nbsp;guards will ask&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave.</p>\r\n  <p><strong>Morning turn: 6AM &ndash; 12PM</strong></p>\r\n  <p><strong>Afternoon turn: 12PM &ndash; 5:30 PM</strong></p>\r\n  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;If you have tickets to&nbsp;climb to Huayna Picchu   or Machu Picchu Mountain, you will have additional time until 2:30   PM.&nbsp;And you can re-enter for a single time as long as it is within the   time of re-entry (05 hours from the first entry)</p>\r\n  <p>If you want&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend all day at Machu Picchu, we can add a ticket&nbsp;for   the&nbsp;afternoon&nbsp;group&nbsp;to your reservation for $ 50 per person.</p>\r\n  <h3>Huayna Picchu / Machu Picchu Mountain</h3>\r\n  <p>Machu Picchu is more beautiful when viewed from above, so it is very   popular to hike one of the mountains next to the ruins after your guided   tour.</p>\r\n  <p>Huayna Picchu is the most popular and must be booked in advance &hellip; it   sells very fast.&nbsp;This hike takes approximately&nbsp;50&nbsp;minutes to the top   and&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes downhill to the bottom.&nbsp;There are 2 schedules or groups   to enter this mountain.&nbsp;The first group&nbsp;is 8-p am and&nbsp;the second&nbsp;is 10   am to 11 am.&nbsp;Again, this refers to when you can start your hike and   normally we reserve the second&nbsp;option&nbsp;so you can first enjoy your tour   with your guide&nbsp;in Machu Picchu.&nbsp;This walk will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;on your own, but   your guide will show you where to start.</p>\r\n  <p>The Machu Picchu mountain is a little longer and less popular.&nbsp;It   takes&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours to reach the top&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;hours to reach the bottom.&nbsp;There   are also 2 visiting hours: from 7-8 am and from 9 am to 10 am and we   usually buy&nbsp;for the second group.</p>\r\n  <h3>Health Concerns</h3>\r\n  <p>It is important that you be honest with your guide about any health   problems you may suffer.&nbsp;Although the guides are not medical   professionals, they are trained in first aid.&nbsp;We also work with a clinic   in Cusco that can help our team.</p>\r\n  <p>You are responsible for evaluating if a trek is suitable for you.&nbsp;You   should consult your doctor to confirm your physical condition to travel   and participate in any planned activity.&nbsp;You should seek advice from   your doctor about vaccinations and medical precautions.&nbsp;Peru Private   Tours will&nbsp;not provide medical advice.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to   assess the risks and requirements of each aspect of the Tour based on   your own circumstances, limitations, fitness level and medical   requirements.</p>\r\n  <p>If during the trek you get sick of extreme altitude or any other   illness that not allows you to continuing with the journey, but you want   to visit Machu Picchu by train, we will work with you to coordinate   this trip.&nbsp;This will be a new trip and may involve additional costs.&nbsp;We   will use as much of the logistics purchased from the original route to   keep rates low.</p>\r\n  <p>If you experience problems while walking and cannot continue, a   porter will escort you to the nearest road and wait while a car comes to   pick you up and take you to the nearest health clinic.</p>\r\n  <h3>Group trips</h3>\r\n  <p>Group tours are made up of different types of people, with different   walking skills and ages.&nbsp;By accepting a group trip, you understand that   some people may be slower or faster than you.&nbsp;Everyone can make their   own pace for the walk, the guide will work through the group to spend   time with everyone.&nbsp;Groups can request some modifications to the tour   and&nbsp;the&nbsp;guide will work with everyone to make the best decision for the   group.</p>\r\n  <h3>Strikes</h3>\r\n  <p>Unfortunately, strikes are very common in Peru and can cause many   interruptions in our Tours.&nbsp;Roads are often blocked, trains stopped.&nbsp;We   will do everything possible to operate your Tour, even before the&nbsp;start   date.&nbsp;Some tours may&nbsp;be canceled under these circumstances.&nbsp;Our   Operations Department will coordinate with you in this situation.&nbsp;Your   safety is always our main concern and will determine how we decide.</p>\r\n  <h3>Lost Items</h3>\r\n  <p>You are responsible for your personal items throughout the Tour.&nbsp;Be   diligent about where&nbsp;you&nbsp;leave your stuff and remember&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all   items from our vans,&nbsp;tents, restaurant, etc.&nbsp;Do not leave anything   involuntary while walking.&nbsp;Other hikers or teams can pick it up without   knowing to whom it belongs.</p>\r\n  <h3>Weather</h3>\r\n  <p>The climate in Cusco and Machu Picchu&nbsp;is unpredictable.&nbsp;In general,   the dry season in&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is from April to October, but this does not   prevent the rain from falling in June or the sun coming out in December,   just prepare for any weather condition.&nbsp;No matter which month you take   the hike or excursion, or which tour you are on, make sure you have   adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and   waterproof gloves.</p>\r\n  <p>Also be prepared for&nbsp;four seasons in a day.&nbsp;Many of the excursions   through the Andes involve many microclimates and you will have to be   prepared for all seasons.&nbsp;The layers are always key because they are   easy to adjust to different temperatures.&nbsp;And the nights will always be   cold, so get ready with a warm jacket.</p>\r\n  <h3>Altitude sickness</h3>\r\n  <p>As soon as the&nbsp;people reserve the trip to&nbsp;Peru, specifically   to&nbsp;Cusco, they begin to wonder about&nbsp;altitude sickness.&nbsp;High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.&nbsp;For few days at high altitude your   body adjusts to the least&nbsp;amount of oxygen in the air.</p>\r\n  <p>The&nbsp;first symptoms of altitude sickness&nbsp;may be;&nbsp;headache,   fatigue,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;loss of appetite, nausea or vomit, dizziness,   trouble sleeping, difficulty breathing during exercise.&nbsp;If any of these   effects worsen, contact our office and we will help you get to a doctor.</p>\r\n  <p>Most of the time, these symptoms will be mild.&nbsp;We always recommend   easy activities and walk&nbsp;slowly, allowing your body to adapt.&nbsp;Drink   plenty of fluids such as water or coca tea.&nbsp;Coca tea&nbsp;has been used since   ancient times to help prevent&nbsp;altitude&nbsp;sickness.&nbsp;The leaves&nbsp;of the coca   plant&nbsp;contain alkaloids that help carry oxygen to the blood, helping   your body avoid the effects of altitude sickness.&nbsp;Avoid drinking a lot   of alcohol and coffee because it will make you urinate more often and   you will become dehydrated.&nbsp;Avoid smoking,&nbsp;Smoking makes it difficult   for your body to get oxygen.&nbsp;Avoid sleeping pills.&nbsp;They can cause   shallow breathing at night, which makes it difficult for your body to   absorb oxygen while you sleep.</p>\r\n  <p>Many people prefer to visit the doctor to give them a treatment with   pills even before traveling to avoid problems during their stay.&nbsp;Your   doctor&nbsp;may prescribe medications, such   as&nbsp;acetazolamide&nbsp;and&nbsp;dexamethasone, to&nbsp;help&nbsp;prevent altitude   sickness.&nbsp;Start the medicine two days before reaching a high   altitude.&nbsp;Continue taking it while you are at high altitude.</p>\r\n  <h3>Travel insurance</h3>\r\n  <p>To protect your travel investment, we recommend buying&nbsp;travel   insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel insurance before leaving home is highly   recommended and very easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending   on your country of origin and at different prices&nbsp;according to your time   of stay, take some time to review them and hire the one that best suits   you.&nbsp;This is an excellent way to&nbsp;protect yourself while visiting Peru.</p>\r\n  <h3>Community</h3>\r\n  <p>At&nbsp;Peru Private Tours (PPT)&nbsp;we are proud&nbsp;of the work we do for our   community. This is&nbsp;the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objective&nbsp;for our company.&nbsp;We are   working&nbsp;directly with the villages to help them meet the needs of their   families.&nbsp;We support the children of the villages by giving them&nbsp;school   supplies,&nbsp;books&nbsp;and clothes.</p>\r\n  <p>We buy all our food from farmers and local markets and serve the   freshest ingredients.&nbsp;We offer&nbsp;constant training&nbsp;for all our team:   guides, porters, chefs and drivers.&nbsp;We are a family born in the Andes   and we want to work with them and for them.&nbsp;That is why once&nbsp;a year we   bring our porters and their families to&nbsp;Machu&nbsp;Picchu.&nbsp;We want our team   to know the world wonder, since they work tirelessly at the doors of   this place without ever visiting it and&nbsp;showing them this place is our   greatest honor.</p>', '', 'inca-jungle-adventure', 0, '', 0, 0, 499.00, 0, '4 days / 3 nights', 0, 0, 0, '<button class=\"wtrvl-checkout_button\" id=\"wetravel_button_widget\" data-env=\"https://www.wetravel.com\" data-version=\"v0.3\" data-uid=\"1162090\" data-uuid=\"20887310\" href=\"https://www.wetravel.com/checkout_embed?uuid=20887310\" style=\"background-color:#33ae3f;color:#ffffff;border: 0px;border-radius: 5px;font-family: \'Poppins\', sans-serif;font-weight: 400;font-size: 14px;-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;text-transform: capitalize;padding: 13px 24px;text-decoration: none;text-align: center;line-height: 14px;display: inline-block; cursor: pointer;\">Book Now</button><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins\" rel=\"stylesheet\"><script src=\"https://cdn.wetravel.com/widgets/embed_checkout.js\"></script>', 6, 4),

although the journey may be long,   especially from&nbsp;Lima,&nbsp;Peru buses&nbsp;are well maintained and are   comfortable.&nbsp;This option is recommended if you come from a city closer   to&nbsp;Cusco like Puno or Arequipa.&nbsp;Buses from Lima will take around 20   hours to arrive to Cusco.</p>\r\n  <h3>Pick Up from The Hotels.</h3>\r\n  <p>We pick up all our clients from the hotel for all tours.&nbsp;While your   hotel is in the center of the city of Cusco, we will coordinate this   pick up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;guide at the information session.&nbsp;Pick-up&nbsp;times&nbsp;may   vary between 20 and 30&nbsp;minutes depending on traffic conditions and   hotel&nbsp;locations.</p>\r\n  <p>Cusco is an ancient city with cobblestone streets and very narrow   corridors.&nbsp;Very small hotels and Air BNBs are often located on streets   that cars cannot pass through.&nbsp;They are also usually located on the side   of the hill, with long and steep climbs to the property, difficult to   maneuver with luggage.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not&nbsp;stay in one of these   places and try to find places where there is easy access to carry your   bags.</p>\r\n  <h3>Leaving Machu Picchu requires a lot of logistics,&nbsp;but&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is&nbsp;included in your journey.</h3>\r\n  <p>From Machu Picchu&nbsp;Ruins&nbsp;to&nbsp;Machu Picchu Pueblo, you&nbsp;will take a   25-minute bus.&nbsp;The&nbsp;buses are in order of arrival and you can take any of   those in turn.</p>\r\n  <p>From Machu Picchu Pueblo,&nbsp;you will take a&nbsp;train&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ollantaytambo or   Poroy&nbsp;station.&nbsp;Your guide will give you your train tickets.&nbsp;Make sure   you get to the platform 30 minutes ahead of time.</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo is 2 hours.</li>\r\n    <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Poroy is 3.5 hours.</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>Once you arrive at the train station, look&nbsp;for our staff with a PPT sign.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will take you to the Plaza San Francisco, Cusco.</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The trip on&nbsp;the van&nbsp;from Ollantaytambo to Plaza de San Francisco is 2 hours</li>\r\n    <li>Travel by&nbsp;van&nbsp;from Poroy to&nbsp;San Francisco Plaza is&nbsp;30 minutes</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>Once you arrive at the Plaza San Francisco&nbsp;our staff will be waiting   for you to separate you and send in pre-paid taxis to your respective   hotels.</p>\r\n  <h3>Entrance fees to Machu Picchu</h3>\r\n  <p>Machu Picchu now has two&nbsp;hours&nbsp;to visit: morning or afternoon.&nbsp;Your   ticket will be&nbsp;for a single&nbsp;entry,&nbsp;in the morning, once your time is   done, the&nbsp;guards will ask&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave.</p>\r\n  <p><strong>Morning turn: 6AM &ndash; 12PM</strong></p>\r\n  <p><strong>Afternoon turn: 12PM &ndash; 5:30 PM</strong></p>\r\n  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;If you have tickets to&nbsp;climb to Huayna Picchu   or Machu Picchu Mountain, you will have additional time until 2:30   PM.&nbsp;And you can re-enter for a single time as long as it is within the   time of re-entry (05 hours from the first entry)</p>\r\n  <p>If you want&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend all day at Machu Picchu, we can add a ticket&nbsp;for   the&nbsp;afternoon&nbsp;group&nbsp;to your reservation for $ 50 per person.</p>\r\n  <h3>Huayna Picchu / Machu Picchu Mountain</h3>\r\n  <p>Machu Picchu is more beautiful when viewed from above, so it is very   popular to hike one of the mountains next to the ruins after your guided   tour.</p>\r\n  <p>Huayna Picchu is the most popular and must be booked in advance &hellip; it   sells very fast.&nbsp;This hike takes approximately&nbsp;50&nbsp;minutes to the top   and&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes downhill to the bottom.&nbsp;There are 2 schedules or groups   to enter this mountain.&nbsp;The first group&nbsp;is 8-p am and&nbsp;the second&nbsp;is 10   am to 11 am.&nbsp;Again, this refers to when you can start your hike and   normally we reserve the second&nbsp;option&nbsp;so you can first enjoy your tour   with your guide&nbsp;in Machu Picchu.&nbsp;This walk will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;on your own, but   your guide will show you where to start.</p>\r\n  <p>The Machu Picchu mountain is a little longer and less popular.&nbsp;It   takes&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours to reach the top&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;hours to reach the bottom.&nbsp;There   are also 2 visiting hours: from 7-8 am and from 9 am to 10 am and we   usually buy&nbsp;for the second group.</p>\r\n  <h3>Health Concerns</h3>\r\n  <p>It is important that you be honest with your guide about any health   problems you may suffer.&nbsp;Although the guides are not medical   professionals, they are trained in first aid.&nbsp;We also work with a clinic   in Cusco that can help our team.</p>\r\n  <p>You are responsible for evaluating if a trek is suitable for you.&nbsp;You   should consult your doctor to confirm your physical condition to travel   and participate in any planned activity.&nbsp;You should seek advice from   your doctor about vaccinations and medical precautions.&nbsp;Peru Private   Tours will&nbsp;not provide medical advice.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to   assess the risks and requirements of each aspect of the Tour based on   your own circumstances, limitations, fitness level and medical   requirements.</p>\r\n  <p>If during the trek you get sick of extreme altitude or any other   illness that not allows you to continuing with the journey, but you want   to visit Machu Picchu by train, we will work with you to coordinate   this trip.&nbsp;This will be a new trip and may involve additional costs.&nbsp;We   will use as much of the logistics purchased from the original route to   keep rates low.</p>\r\n  <p>If you experience problems while walking and cannot continue, a   porter will escort you to the nearest road and wait while a car comes to   pick you up and take you to the nearest health clinic.</p>\r\n  <h3>Group trips</h3>\r\n  <p>Group tours are made up of different types of people, with different   walking skills and ages.&nbsp;By accepting a group trip, you understand that   some people may be slower or faster than you.&nbsp;Everyone can make their   own pace for the walk, the guide will work through the group to spend   time with everyone.&nbsp;Groups can request some modifications to the tour   and&nbsp;the&nbsp;guide will work with everyone to make the best decision for the   group.</p>\r\n  <h3>Strikes</h3>\r\n  <p>Unfortunately, strikes are very common in Peru and can cause many   interruptions in our Tours.&nbsp;Roads are often blocked, trains stopped.&nbsp;We   will do everything possible to operate your Tour, even before the&nbsp;start   date.&nbsp;Some tours may&nbsp;be canceled under these circumstances.&nbsp;Our   Operations Department will coordinate with you in this situation.&nbsp;Your   safety is always our main concern and will determine how we decide.</p>\r\n  <h3>Lost Items</h3>\r\n  <p>You are responsible for your personal items throughout the Tour.&nbsp;Be   diligent about where&nbsp;you&nbsp;leave your stuff and remember&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all   items from our vans,&nbsp;tents, restaurant, etc.&nbsp;Do not leave anything   involuntary while walking.&nbsp;Other hikers or teams can pick it up without   knowing to whom it belongs.</p>\r\n  <h3>Weather</h3>\r\n  <p>The climate in Cusco and Machu Picchu&nbsp;is unpredictable.&nbsp;In general,   the dry season in&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is from April to October, but this does not   prevent the rain from falling in June or the sun coming out in December,   just prepare for any weather condition.&nbsp;No matter which month you take   the hike or excursion, or which tour you are on, make sure you have   adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and   waterproof gloves.</p>\r\n  <p>Also be prepared for&nbsp;four seasons in a day.&nbsp;Many of the excursions   through the Andes involve many microclimates and you will have to be   prepared for all seasons.&nbsp;The layers are always key because they are   easy to adjust to different temperatures.&nbsp;And the nights will always be   cold, so get ready with a warm jacket.</p>\r\n  <h3>Altitude sickness</h3>\r\n  <p>As soon as the&nbsp;people reserve the trip to&nbsp;Peru, specifically   to&nbsp;Cusco, they begin to wonder about&nbsp;altitude sickness.&nbsp;High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.&nbsp;For few days at high altitude your   body adjusts to the least&nbsp;amount of oxygen in the air.</p>\r\n  <p>The&nbsp;first symptoms of altitude sickness&nbsp;may be;&nbsp;headache,   fatigue,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;loss of appetite, nausea or vomit, dizziness,   trouble sleeping, difficulty breathing during exercise.&nbsp;If any of these   effects worsen, contact our office and we will help you get to a doctor.</p>\r\n  <p>Most of the time, these symptoms will be mild.&nbsp;We always recommend   easy activities and walk&nbsp;slowly, allowing your body to adapt.&nbsp;Drink   plenty of fluids such as water or coca tea.&nbsp;Coca tea&nbsp;has been used since   ancient times to help prevent&nbsp;altitude&nbsp;sickness.&nbsp;The leaves&nbsp;of the coca   plant&nbsp;contain alkaloids that help carry oxygen to the blood, helping   your body avoid the effects of altitude sickness.&nbsp;Avoid drinking a lot   of alcohol and coffee because it will make you urinate more often and   you will become dehydrated.&nbsp;Avoid smoking,&nbsp;Smoking makes it difficult   for your body to get oxygen.&nbsp;Avoid sleeping pills.&nbsp;They can cause   shallow breathing at night, which makes it difficult for your body to   absorb oxygen while you sleep.</p>\r\n  <p>Many people prefer to visit the doctor to give them a treatment with   pills even before traveling to avoid problems during their stay.&nbsp;Your   doctor&nbsp;may prescribe medications, such   as&nbsp;acetazolamide&nbsp;and&nbsp;dexamethasone, to&nbsp;help&nbsp;prevent altitude   sickness.&nbsp;Start the medicine two days before reaching a high   altitude.&nbsp;Continue taking it while you are at high altitude.</p>\r\n  <h3>Travel insurance</h3>\r\n  <p>To protect your travel investment, we recommend buying&nbsp;travel   insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel insurance before leaving home is highly   recommended and very easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending   on your country of origin and at different prices&nbsp;according to your time   of stay, take some time to review them and hire the one that best suits   you.&nbsp;This is an excellent way to&nbsp;protect yourself while visiting Peru.</p>\r\n  <h3>Community</h3>\r\n  <p>At&nbsp;Peru Private Tours (PPT)&nbsp;we are proud&nbsp;of the work we do for our   community. This is&nbsp;the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objective&nbsp;for our company.&nbsp;We are   working&nbsp;directly with the villages to help them meet the needs of their   families.&nbsp;We support the children of the villages by giving them&nbsp;school   supplies,&nbsp;books&nbsp;and clothes.</p>\r\n  <p>We buy all our food from farmers and local markets and serve the   freshest ingredients.&nbsp;We offer&nbsp;constant training&nbsp;for all our team:   guides, porters, chefs and drivers.&nbsp;We are a family born in the Andes   and we want to work with them and for them.&nbsp;That is why once&nbsp;a year we   bring our porters and their families to&nbsp;Machu&nbsp;Picchu.&nbsp;We want our team   to know the world wonder, since they work tirelessly at the doors of   this place without ever visiting it and&nbsp;showing them this place is our   greatest honor.</p>', '', 'lares-trek', 0, '', 0, 0, 549.00, 0, '4 days / 3 nights', 0, 0, 0, '<button class=\"wtrvl-checkout_button\" id=\"wetravel_button_widget\" data-env=\"https://www.wetravel.com\" data-version=\"v0.3\" data-uid=\"1162090\" data-uuid=\"88085464\" href=\"https://www.wetravel.com/checkout_embed?uuid=88085464\" style=\"background-color:#33ae3f;color:#ffffff;border: 0px;border-radius: 5px;font-family: \'Poppins\', sans-serif;font-weight: 400;font-size: 14px;-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;text-transform: capitalize;padding: 13px 24px;text-decoration: none;text-align: center;line-height: 14px;display: inline-block; cursor: pointer;\">Book Now</button><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins\" rel=\"stylesheet\"><script src=\"https://cdn.wetravel.com/widgets/embed_checkout.js\"></script>', 6, 4);

Picchu.LATAMis the most reliable airline.Avianca and Peruvian   Airlinesare also acceptable companies.You will not return from your   tour on the last day until around 8 pm So make sure your flight is

yourself while visiting <strong>Peru.</strong></li>\r\n  </ul>', '<h3>Breafing (Previous Information)</h3>\r\n<p>All information sessions are held in our office at 06:00 PM the night   before your trek.&nbsp;If you cannot assist to this talk please contact our   office staff to serve you better.</p>\r\n<h3>Duffle Bags</h3>\r\n<p>You will receive your duffle bag at the information session.&nbsp;These   bags are to put your belongings inside it, these will be carried by the   porters and will be returned to you each evening at the   campsite.&nbsp;However, beside from these bags, you should carry a small   backpack where you will carry everything you need during the trek.</p>\r\n<p>Each duffle bag must have a maximum weight of 7kg.&nbsp;4kg will be for   your clothes and other personal items, the other 3kg will be for our   logistics, such as your sleeping bag and pad, if you have your own   sleeping bag and mat these must be included in the 7 kilos.</p>\r\n<h3>Arrive in Cusco</h3>\r\n<p>The airport in Cusco&nbsp;is currently&nbsp;quite small and only for domestic   flights, so all international travelers by plane must disembark   in&nbsp;Lima&nbsp;and go through Customs.&nbsp;Even if your flight to&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is the same   day by the same airline, you must pick up your bags in Lima and then   register them again.</p>\r\n<p>The best way to get to Cusco is by air and there are several&nbsp;airline   options.&nbsp;LATAM&nbsp;tends to be the most expensive, but it   has&nbsp;more&nbsp;flight&nbsp;options.&nbsp;But you also have&nbsp;PERUVIAN, AVIANCA, STAR PERU,   LC PERU&nbsp;to choose according to your preference.&nbsp;Expect&nbsp;flight delays or   cancellations,&nbsp;due to the high&nbsp;altitude of Cusco, tends to be difficult   to land&nbsp;so that on rainy days you can paralyze&nbsp;air traffic.&nbsp;Bus   tours&nbsp;are always available and although the journey may be long,   especially from&nbsp;Lima,&nbsp;Peru buses&nbsp;are well maintained and are   comfortable.&nbsp;This option is recommended if you come from a city closer   to&nbsp;Cusco like Puno or Arequipa.&nbsp;Buses from Lima will take around 20   hours to arrive to Cusco.</p>\r\n<h3>Pick Up from The Hotels.</h3>\r\n<p>We pick up all our clients from the hotel for all tours.&nbsp;While your   hotel is in the center of the city of Cusco, we will coordinate this   pick up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;guide at the information session.&nbsp;Pick-up&nbsp;times&nbsp;may   vary between 20 and 30&nbsp;minutes depending on traffic conditions and   hotel&nbsp;locations.</p>\r\n<p>Cusco is an ancient city with cobblestone streets and very narrow   corridors.&nbsp;Very small hotels and Air BNBs are often located on streets   that cars cannot pass through.&nbsp;They are also usually located on the side   of the hill, with long and steep climbs to the property, difficult to   maneuver with luggage.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not&nbsp;stay in one of these   places and try to find places where there is easy access to carry your   bags.</p>\r\n<h3>Leaving Machu Picchu requires a lot of logistics,&nbsp;but&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is&nbsp;included in your journey.</h3>\r\n<p>From Machu Picchu&nbsp;Ruins&nbsp;to&nbsp;Machu Picchu Pueblo, you&nbsp;will take a   25-minute bus.&nbsp;The&nbsp;buses are in order of arrival and you can take any of   those in turn.</p>\r\n<p>From Machu Picchu Pueblo,&nbsp;you will take a&nbsp;train&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ollantaytambo or   Poroy&nbsp;station.&nbsp;Your guide will give you your train tickets.&nbsp;Make sure   you get to the platform 30 minutes ahead of time.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo is 2 hours.</li>\r\n  <li>The train from Aguas Calientes to Poroy is 3.5 hours.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you arrive at the train station, look&nbsp;for our staff with a PPT sign.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will take you to the Plaza San Francisco, Cusco.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The trip on&nbsp;the van&nbsp;from Ollantaytambo to Plaza de San Francisco is 2 hours</li>\r\n  <li>Travel by&nbsp;van&nbsp;from Poroy to&nbsp;San Francisco Plaza is&nbsp;30 minutes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you arrive at the Plaza San Francisco&nbsp;our staff will be waiting   for you to separate you and send in pre-paid taxis to your respective   hotels.</p>\r\n<h3>Entrance fees to Machu Picchu</h3>\r\n<p>Machu Picchu now has two&nbsp;hours&nbsp;to visit: morning or afternoon.&nbsp;Your   ticket will be&nbsp;for a single&nbsp;entry,&nbsp;in the morning, once your time is   done, the&nbsp;guards will ask&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Morning turn: 6AM &ndash; 12PM</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Afternoon turn: 12PM &ndash; 5:30 PM</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;If you have tickets to&nbsp;climb to Huayna Picchu   or Machu Picchu Mountain, you will have additional time until 2:30   PM.&nbsp;And you can re-enter for a single time as long as it is within the   time of re-entry (05 hours from the first entry)</p>\r\n<p>If you want&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend all day at Machu Picchu, we can add a ticket&nbsp;for   the&nbsp;afternoon&nbsp;group&nbsp;to your reservation for $ 50 per person.</p>\r\n<h3>Huayna Picchu / Machu Picchu Mountain</h3>\r\n<p>Machu Picchu is more beautiful when viewed from above, so it is very   popular to hike one of the mountains next to the ruins after your guided   tour.</p>\r\n<p>Huayna Picchu is the most popular and must be booked in advance &hellip; it   sells very fast.&nbsp;This hike takes approximately&nbsp;50&nbsp;minutes to the top   and&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes downhill to the bottom.&nbsp;There are 2 schedules or groups   to enter this mountain.&nbsp;The first group&nbsp;is 8-p am and&nbsp;the second&nbsp;is 10   am to 11 am.&nbsp;Again, this refers to when you can start your hike and   normally we reserve the second&nbsp;option&nbsp;so you can first enjoy your tour   with your guide&nbsp;in Machu Picchu.&nbsp;This walk will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;on your own, but   your guide will show you where to start.</p>\r\n<p>The Machu Picchu mountain is a little longer and less popular.&nbsp;It   takes&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours to reach the top&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;hours to reach the bottom.&nbsp;There   are also 2 visiting hours: from 7-8 am and from 9 am to 10 am and we   usually buy&nbsp;for the second group.</p>\r\n<h3>Health Concerns</h3>\r\n<p>It is important that you be honest with your guide about any health   problems you may suffer.&nbsp;Although the guides are not medical   professionals, they are trained in first aid.&nbsp;We also work with a clinic   in Cusco that can help our team.</p>\r\n<p>You are responsible for evaluating if a trek is suitable for you.&nbsp;You   should consult your doctor to confirm your physical condition to travel   and participate in any planned activity.&nbsp;You should seek advice from   your doctor about vaccinations and medical precautions.&nbsp;Peru Private   Tours will&nbsp;not provide medical advice.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to   assess the risks and requirements of each aspect of the Tour based on   your own circumstances, limitations, fitness level and medical   requirements.</p>\r\n<p>If during the trek you get sick of extreme altitude or any other   illness that not allows you to continuing with the journey, but you want   to visit Machu Picchu by train, we will work with you to coordinate   this trip.&nbsp;This will be a new trip and may involve additional costs.&nbsp;We   will use as much of the logistics purchased from the original route to   keep rates low.</p>\r\n<p>If you experience problems while walking and cannot continue, a   porter will escort you to the nearest road and wait while a car comes to   pick you up and take you to the nearest health clinic.</p>\r\n<h3>Group trips</h3>\r\n<p>Group tours are made up of different types of people, with different   walking skills and ages.&nbsp;By accepting a group trip, you understand that   some people may be slower or faster than you.&nbsp;Everyone can make their   own pace for the walk, the guide will work through the group to spend   time with everyone.&nbsp;Groups can request some modifications to the tour   and&nbsp;the&nbsp;guide will work with everyone to make the best decision for the   group.</p>\r\n<h3>Strikes</h3>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, strikes are very common in Peru and can cause many   interruptions in our Tours.&nbsp;Roads are often blocked, trains stopped.&nbsp;We   will do everything possible to operate your Tour, even before the&nbsp;start   date.&nbsp;Some tours may&nbsp;be canceled under these circumstances.&nbsp;Our   Operations Department will coordinate with you in this situation.&nbsp;Your   safety is always our main concern and will determine how we decide.</p>\r\n<h3>Lost Items</h3>\r\n<p>You are responsible for your personal items throughout the Tour.&nbsp;Be   diligent about where&nbsp;you&nbsp;leave your stuff and remember&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all   items from our vans,&nbsp;tents, restaurant, etc.&nbsp;Do not leave anything   involuntary while walking.&nbsp;Other hikers or teams can pick it up without   knowing to whom it belongs.</p>\r\n<h3>Weather</h3>\r\n<p>The climate in Cusco and Machu Picchu&nbsp;is unpredictable.&nbsp;In general,   the dry season in&nbsp;Cusco&nbsp;is from April to October, but this does not   prevent the rain from falling in June or the sun coming out in December,   just prepare for any weather condition.&nbsp;No matter which month you take   the hike or excursion, or which tour you are on, make sure you have   adequate clothing that includes a waterproof jacket, pants, poncho and   waterproof gloves.</p>\r\n<p>Also be prepared for&nbsp;four seasons in a day.&nbsp;Many of the excursions   through the Andes involve many microclimates and you will have to be   prepared for all seasons.&nbsp;The layers are always key because they are   easy to adjust to different temperatures.&nbsp;And the nights will always be   cold, so get ready with a warm jacket.</p>\r\n<h3>Altitude sickness</h3>\r\n<p>As soon as the&nbsp;people reserve the trip to&nbsp;Peru, specifically   to&nbsp;Cusco, they begin to wonder about&nbsp;altitude sickness.&nbsp;High altitudes   contains less oxygen than at sea level and forces your body to work   harder to get the oxygen it needs.&nbsp;For few days at high altitude your   body adjusts to the least&nbsp;amount of oxygen in the air.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;first symptoms of altitude sickness&nbsp;may be;&nbsp;headache,   fatigue,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;loss of appetite, nausea or vomit, dizziness,   trouble sleeping, difficulty breathing during exercise.&nbsp;If any of these   effects worsen, contact our office and we will help you get to a doctor.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the time, these symptoms will be mild.&nbsp;We always recommend   easy activities and walk&nbsp;slowly, allowing your body to adapt.&nbsp;Drink   plenty of fluids such as water or coca tea.&nbsp;Coca tea&nbsp;has been used since   ancient times to help prevent&nbsp;altitude&nbsp;sickness.&nbsp;The leaves&nbsp;of the coca   plant&nbsp;contain alkaloids that help carry oxygen to the blood, helping   your body avoid the effects of altitude sickness.&nbsp;Avoid drinking a lot   of alcohol and coffee because it will make you urinate more often and   you will become dehydrated.&nbsp;Avoid smoking,&nbsp;Smoking makes it difficult   for your body to get oxygen.&nbsp;Avoid sleeping pills.&nbsp;They can cause   shallow breathing at night, which makes it difficult for your body to   absorb oxygen while you sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Many people prefer to visit the doctor to give them a treatment with   pills even before traveling to avoid problems during their stay.&nbsp;Your   doctor&nbsp;may prescribe medications, such   as&nbsp;acetazolamide&nbsp;and&nbsp;dexamethasone, to&nbsp;help&nbsp;prevent altitude   sickness.&nbsp;Start the medicine two days before reaching a high   altitude.&nbsp;Continue taking it while you are at high altitude.</p>\r\n<h3>Travel insurance</h3>\r\n<p>To protect your travel investment, we recommend buying&nbsp;travel   insurance.&nbsp;Getting travel insurance before leaving home is highly   recommended and very easy.&nbsp;There are many insurance companies depending   on your country of origin and at different prices&nbsp;according to your time   of stay, take some time to review them and hire the one that best suits   you.&nbsp;This is an excellent way to&nbsp;protect yourself while visiting Peru.</p>\r\n<h3>Community</h3>\r\n<p>At&nbsp;Peru Private Tours (PPT)&nbsp;we are proud&nbsp;of the work we do for our   community. This is&nbsp;the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objective&nbsp;for our company.&nbsp;We are   working&nbsp;directly with the villages to help them meet the needs of their   families.&nbsp;We support the children of the villages by giving them&nbsp;school   supplies,&nbsp;books&nbsp;and clothes.</p>\r\n<p>We buy all our food from farmers and local markets and serve the   freshest ingredients.&nbsp;We offer&nbsp;constant training&nbsp;for all our team:   guides, porters, chefs and drivers.&nbsp;We are a family born in the Andes   and we want to work with them and for them.&nbsp;That is why once&nbsp;a year we   bring our porters and their families to&nbsp;Machu&nbsp;Picchu.&nbsp;We want our team   to know the world wonder, since they work tirelessly at the doors of   this place without ever visiting it and&nbsp;showing them this place is our   greatest honor.</p>', '', 'salkantay-trek-5-days-4-nights', 0, '', 0, 0, 0.00, 0, '5 days / 4 nights', 0, 0, 0, '<button class=\"wtrvl-checkout_button\" id=\"wetravel_button_widget\" data-env=\"https://www.wetravel.com\" data-version=\"v0.3\" data-uid=\"1162090\" data-uuid=\"88356623\" href=\"https://www.wetravel.com/checkout_embed?uuid=88356623\" style=\"background-color:#33ae3f;color:#ffffff;border: 0px;border-radius: 5px;font-family: \'Poppins\', sans-serif;font-weight: 400;font-size: 14px;-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;text-transform: capitalize;padding: 13px 24px;text-decoration: none;text-align: center;line-height: 14px;display: inline-block; cursor: pointer;\">Book Now</button><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins\" rel=\"stylesheet\"><script src=\"https://cdn.wetravel.com/widgets/embed_checkout.js\"></script>', 7, 4);
